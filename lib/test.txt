An online petition in support of Nagaenthran has <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/pardon-the-death-sentence-of-an-intellectually-disabled-man\">attracted more than 62,000 signatures</a>.</p> <p>According to campaigners, it was disclosed during the trial that Nagaenthran has an IQ of 69, a level recognised as indicating a learning disability, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. His supporters say there is evidence that Nagaenthran was forced to courier drugs as a victim of human trafficking.</p> <p>The Malaysian prime minister, Ismail Sabri Yaakob, has written to Singapore’s prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, to ask for leniency in his case, according to Malaysian media, while the EU’s delegation to Singapore has issued a statement calling for the execution to be stopped.</p> <p>More than 200 family members and friends of prisoners who have lived on death row in Singapore have also called for Nagaenthran to be spared, and for the death penalty to be abolished.</p> <p>“There are no words to describe the pain of having a loved one on death row.

Often, as a result of their marginalisation, they find themselves in desperate and compromising situations.”</p> <p>A group of eight British MPs and peers has written to the UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, requesting she make urgent representations to her counterpart in Singapore “urging them to ensure that an intellectually disabled victim of trafficking is not executed after what may amount to a grave miscarriage of justice”.</p> <p>Singapore has some of the world’s harshest drugs laws, and the death penalty is mandatory for anyone found guilty of importing more than 15 grams of diamorphine. However, amendments passed in 2014 granted the court discretion to impose a life sentence rather than the death penalty if the defendant was only acting as a courier and “was suffering from such abnormality of mind as substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his acts and omissions in relation to the offence”.</p> <p>Rights groups say that executing someone with an intellectual or psychosocial disability is a violation of international laws and standards.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/05/japan-death-row-inmates-sue-over-same-day-notification-of-execution-report\">Death row inmates sue over Japan’s brief notice of execution</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The European Union’s delegation to Singapore <a href=\"https://eeas.europa.eu/sites/default/files/final_joint_local_statement_preceding_the_execution_of_nagaenthran_on_10_november_2021.pdf\">issued a statement</a> calling for Nagaenthran’s sentence to be commuted to a non-capital sentence. “No compelling evidence exists to show that the death penalty serves as a more efficient deterrent to crime than imprisonment,” it said.</p> <p>During a hearing on Monday, Nagaenthran’s lawyer argued that executing Nagaenthran, a man with learning disabilities, would violate Singapore’s constitution. The high court ordered a stay of execution pending the hearing of an appeal to the court of appeal, his lawyer, M Ravi said. It is not clear when the appeal hearing will take place.</p> <p>Emina Ćerimović, a senior disability rights researcher at Human Rights Watch said in a statement last week that the sentences were “disproportionate and cruel, and deserve global condemnation”.</p> <p>Rachel Chhoa-Howard, Amnesty International’s Singapore researcher, added: “Taking people’s lives is a cruel act in itself but to hang a person convicted merely of carrying drugs, amid chilling testimony that he might not even fully understand what is happening to him, is despicable.”</p> <p>In a statement last week, Singapore’s ministry of home affairs said Nagaenthran “was accorded full due process under the law, and was represented by legal counsel throughout the process. His petition to the president for clemency was unsuccessful.”</p> <p>Nagaenthran was caught trafficking 42.72 grams of diamorphine, it said, “equivalent to about 3,560 straws of heroin.

(That’s because the standards committee recommends what should happen if MPs have broken the rules, although now half of the committee’s members are non-MPs.) He said he thought judges should take the final decision. He told Sky News:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The problem lies with the Commons own rules and I’ve argued with Chris [Bryant, the standards committee chair] over many months that the rules need to change.</p> <p>I don’t think MPs should be adjudicating on issues against other MPs.

She told Sky News:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think the question of whether MPs having jobs that involve lobbying, I think, perhaps should be looked at again.</p> </blockquote> <p>MPs are already supposed to be banned from paid lobbying, but there is a loophole that allows lobbying if it will expose a “serious wrong” and MPs are allowed to give consultancy advice that helps companies with their own lobbying, as long as they do not actually pick up the phone themselves. </p> <p>Later Trevelyan told Today:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We should never rule out completely second jobs [for MPs] ... The question is, are we looking at second jobs or specifically some types of consultancy. Personally, I think we should look at that.

MPs will this afternoon hold a three-hour debate on sleaze, or rather on “the consequences of the decision of the house of 3 November relating to standards”, as the motion more coyly put it. Last night Labour announced that Keir Starmer would be leading for his party, and it challenged Boris Johnson to turn up to. “Boris Johnson needs to attend this debate, answer for his mistakes apologise to the country and take action to undo the damage he has done,” Starmer said, in a statement best described as an aspiration rather than an expectation. (Johnson is even more allergic to apologising than most politicians.) The Lib Dems, who called for today’s emergency debate, have also got their own improbable request; they want Johnson to launch a public inquiry into all the sleaze allegations dogging his government.</p> <p><strong>Anne-Marie Trevelyan</strong>, the international trade secretary, has been doing the morning interview round and, when she was asked on Sky News if Johnson would attend the debate, she said she did not know. (Yesterday government sources were saying Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, would speak for the government, but that was before Labour said they were putting up Starmer.) Asked if Johnson should be speaking, Trevelyan replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>My opinion would be that no, he shouldn’t be there. He will no doubt, as we all do, have the House of Commons on in his office as he’s dealing with many, many other issues that only the prime minister can deal with.

And in a nod to concerns over environmental impact of transatlantic flights, Weiss says both airlines are using A350-1000s, the most fuel-efficient planes in their fleets.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The competition will not be who gets their quickest, but rather who gets there on time with the most efficient use of fuel.</p> </blockquote> <p>Looking ahead, Weiss says that demand will be unpredictable for a bit, but Virgin Atlantic is already seeing very strong demand for Christmas, Easter, and next summer. And this week is ‘absolutely full’.</p> <p>Business travel will follow, he insists, despite the boom in video-conferencing tools since the move to homeworking, with signs that small and medium-sized firms are travelling again. </p> <p><em>Q: But what about the climate damage caused by international travel? Two A350s just took off simultaneously to take passengers to the US, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/08/cop26-whats-still-to-be-resolved-in-the-week-ahead\">in the middle of the Cop26 talks in Glasgow</a>. What can passengers do to be more environmentally aware?</em><br></p> <p>Weiss says aviation ‘needs to do its part’. Airlines have committed to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-04/airline-industry-targets-net-zero-carbon-emissions-by-2050\">become net-zero by 2050,</a> -- but he admits that’s a long way away. So Virgin is taking steps like using younger planes (68% of its fleets are next-generation jets which are more fuel-efficient).</p> <p><strong>And Weiss suggests that travellers need to be conscious about the issue too, saying:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The day trip to Brussels, the day trip to New York may be not the best use of time. But combining leisure and business into a longer trip is the thing to do.</p> </blockquote> <p>And on the pandemic, Weiss says that the successful vaccination development, high vaccination rates <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/nov/05/pfizer-covid-pills-highly-effective-at-preventing-deaths-trial-suggests\">and new treatments coming online</a> gives him confidence that we are moving forwards not backwards.

But it is more than 600 days since the airlines have been able to sell into their biggest market, crucial as they seek to recover from the pandemic.</p> <p>Speaking before the flight, Virgin chief executive Shai Weiss described it as “a tipping point”.</p> <p>Plenty of other flights were taking off from Heathrow Terminal 5 – if roughly half the number of two years ago - but there was only one destination in town. To underline the significance for anyone who missed it, the BA check-in, the cabins and even the air bridge from the gate to the plane festooned with American flags.</p> <p>The planes took to the skies just after 8.50am – using their most fuel-efficient models, A350s, after both airlines having retired their famous 747 jumbos early as a cost-saving measure during the pandemic. BA flight 001 took off on the northern runway, with Virgin flight VS3 rising into the air exactly in parallel.</p> <p>BA chief executive Sean Doyle told passengers over the tannoy:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>“This is a real moment of celebration. I know how much today means to you – some have not seen your loved ones for two years, others have not been able to do business.”</p> </blockquote> <p>He also told them that flight BA001 was powered by a blend of 35% sustainable aviation fuel [SAF] – the largest mix used yet on a commercial flight, while remaining emissions would be offset, via wind and solar power projects. </p> <p>“In the years ahead,” Doyle said, “we envisage all our long haul flights will be powered by SAFs.”<br></p> <p><strong>It was a reminder that aviation still has plenty of challenges ahead. For now, though, some optimism has returned.</strong></p> <p>Friends and family were some of the first to book to fill planes this week, the airlines said, with planes across Virgin’s US departures 98% full till Wednesday. Doyle said there had been a significant bookings too from corporate customers and small businesses, giving lie to the idea that business travel was dead. Bankers in particular had booked to fly back, boosting the revenues from premium cabins.</p> <p>But holidaymakers have also filled the front ends of the planes, according to BA Holidays managing director Claire Bentley: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>“People are upgrading, treating themselves.” </p> </blockquote> <p>City breaks had generally not been sought after during the pandemic, for those who did try to get away despite the testing requirements and travel restrictions, she said. </p> <p>The US east coast’s biggest city has long been its best seller though and is coming back fast: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>“New York is in a category of its own.”</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-6188e9528f0833c57fc5a2ce\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-11-08T09:09:40.634Z\">9.09am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here’s a picture of the parallel takeoff, via Twitter user <strong>Andrew McConnell:</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Andrewmc1975/status/1457633334989832192\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A momentous day for aviation as UK-USA travel reopens.

Carbon market trading programs are arms of genocide.”</p> <p>The People’s Summit continues with around 200 virtual and in-person events across the city taking place through Wednesday. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-6188f4e48f0833c57fc5a36a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-11-08T10:21:20.030Z\">10.21am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It’s time for news of an elaborate Monday morning practical joke.

She had already been in detention since her initial arrest in May 2020, and has been on hunger strike. Last week, her family warned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/05/chinese-journalist-jailed-over-covid-reporting-is-close-to-death-family-say\">the 38-year-old was “close to death”</a>, amplifying global calls for her immediate release.</p> <p>In its nomination on Monday, RSF said Zhang had withstood “constant threats from the authorities” in order to livestream her video reports from Wuhan’s streets and hospitals and show the harassment to which families of Covid-19 patients were subjected.</p> <p>“Widely shared on social media, her reporting was one of the main sources of independent information about the health situation in Wuhan at the time,” it said.</p> <p>Zhang, who was among a number of journalists arrested in Wuhan but was the first convicted, was accused of having sent “false information through text, video and other media through the internet media such as WeChat, Twitter and YouTube”, and having “maliciously speculated” during interviews with foreign press, according to the indictment sheet.</p> <p>RSF’s nomination noted claims made by Zhang’s lawyer in the days after her conviction that she had been shackled in her cell and force-fed.</p> <p>“There is currently a great deal of concern that she could be subjected to further torture and ill-treatment,” said RSF.</p> <p>Zhang is being held in Shanghai. Last week her brother said on Twitter that she was severely underweight and “may not live for much longer”. He said Zhang, who is about 5ft 10in (177cm) tall, weighed just 6 stone 4lbs (40kg).</p> <p>The RSF east Asia Bureau head, Cédric Alviani, said Zhang was a symbol of journalism in China under growing government oppression and regulatory restriction.</p> <p>“Zhang Zhan represents the hope of the Chinese people that some will keep doing journalism,” Alviani said. “That they go where something happens and keep reporting. The Chinese people, like every person on Earth, crave information on what’s happening around them.”</p> <p>RSF was among a number of NGOs calling for Zhang’s immediate release. Alviani said the conviction should be dropped but that at the very least, given the immediate health concerns, she should be released on humanitarian grounds.</p> <p>“The Chinese regime should never have judged her,” he said. “She should be celebrated as a hero – she risked her life going to Wuhan at a moment when no one really knew what was going on.”</p> <p>Zhang was nominated for the Prize for Courage, one of three Press Freedom prizes, alongside <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/30/myanmar-junta-frees-more-than-2000-anti-coup-protesters\">Kay Zon Nway</a>, a Myanmar journalist who was jailed for 124 days jailed after she was arrested in February while livestreaming an anti-coup protest; Patricia Devlin who has faced personal threats while reporting on organised crime and paramilitary activities in Northern Ireland; and the Nicaraguan weekly newspaper Confidencial, which has been repeatedly raided and its journalists targeted by authorities under Daniel Ortega’s government.</p> <p>“These men, women and media outlets fight with courage and determination against converging forces that undermine journalistic independence,” said the RSF secretary general, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/christophe-deloire\">Christophe Deloire</a>. “The RSF Awards is a tribute and above all a support for all those who embody journalism’s ideals.”</p>", "thumbnail"=>"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0c9cc522b9bcdc3857c14bc6e44991f0dedda90/69_53_2437_1462/500.jpg"}, "isHosted"=>false, "pillarId"=>"pillar/news", "pillarName"=>"News"}]}}
