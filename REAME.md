# Week 4: Chitter challenge

### Setup

I'm starting off by setting up the following:
..* Sinatra to create the web application
..* Capybara to allow testing of the web application
..* Selenium Webdriver allows the automation of the web browser
..* PostgreSQL for the database
..* Sinatra-Flash for any flash notifications



### Setting up the foundation

I will be starting by setting up the basic web app file.

In order to meet the MVP for the challenge, I want the entry box at the top. The box should record the name of the sender (which can be implemented later), the "peep" box, and the timestamp of when the user presses submit.

I want the "peeps" to pop up below the box in reverse chronological order below this box.
