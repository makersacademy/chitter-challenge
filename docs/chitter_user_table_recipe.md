# Two Tables Design Recipe Template

_Copy this recipe template to design and create two related database tables from a specification._

## 1. Extract nouns from the user stories or specification

```
As a Maker
So that I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to sign up for Chitter

I want to log in to Chitter

I want to log out of Chitter

I want to receive an email if I am tagged in a Peep
```

```
Nouns:

chitter, peep, created_at, users, email, password, name, username
```

## 2. Infer the Table Name and Columns

Put the different nouns in this table. Replace the example with your own nouns.

| Record                | Properties          |
| --------------------- | ------------------  |
| chitter               | peep, created_at
| users                 | email, password, name, username

1. Name of the first table (always plural): `chitters` 

    Column names: `peep`, `created_at`

2. Name of the second table (always plural): `users` 

    Column names: `email` `password` `name` `username`

## 3. Decide the column types.

[Here's a full documentation of PostgreSQL data types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype.html).

Most of the time, you'll need either `text`, `int`, `bigint`, `numeric`, or `boolean`. If you're in doubt, do some research or ask your peers.

Remember to **always** have the primary key `id` as a first column. Its type will always be `SERIAL`.

```
# EXAMPLE:

Table: chitters
id: SERIAL
peep: text
created_at: time

Table: users
id: SERIAL
email: text
password: text
name: text
username: text
```

## 4. Decide on The Tables Relationship

Most of the time, you'll be using a **one-to-many** relationship, and will need a **foreign key** on one of the two tables.

To decide on which one, answer these two questions:

1. Can one [user] have many [peeps]? (Yes)
2. Can one [peep] have many [users]? (No)

You'll then be able to say that:

1. **[A] has many [B]**
2. And on the other side, **[B] belongs to [A]**
3. In that case, the foreign key is in the table [B]

Replace the relevant bits in this example with your own:

```
# EXAMPLE

1. Can one artist have many albums? YES
2. Can one album have many artists? NO

-> Therefore,
-> An user HAS MANY peeps
-> A peep BELONGS TO an user

-> Therefore, the foreign key is on the peeps table.
```

*If you can answer YES to the two questions, you'll probably have to implement a Many-to-Many relationship, which is more complex and needs a third table (called a join table).*

## 4. Write the SQL.

```sql
-- EXAMPLE
-- file: peeps_table.sql

-- Replace the table name, columm names and types.

-- Create the table without the foreign key first.
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  email text,
  password text,
  name text,
  username text
);


-- Then the table with the foreign key first.
CREATE TABLE chitters (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  peep text,
  created_at timestamp,
-- The foreign key name is always {other_table_singular}_id
  user_id int,
  constraint fk_user foreign key(peep_id)
    references users(id)
    on delete cascade
);

```

## 5. Create the tables.

```bash
psql -h 127.0.0.1 database_name < albums_table.sql
```
