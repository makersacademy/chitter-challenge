## Functionality to implement if time 

### Peeps 

* Peeps start on a new line after a certain no. of chars
* Limitations to peep length 
* Automatically sets post time to a peep
* **Essential** - restricting peeps to only logged in users. (currently if users visited /peep/new they could attempt to create a peep and crash the programme)

### Users 

* Account validation - unique accounts and usernames 
* Login variation - app currently crashes with wrong log ins 
* Implement password hashing via Bcrypt 

### Views 
* Beautify pages
