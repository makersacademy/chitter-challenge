# Single Table Design Recipe Template

_Copy this recipe template to design and create a database table from a specification._

## 1. Extract nouns from the user stories or specification

```
As a Maker
So that I can let people know what I am doing  
I want to post a message (peep) to chitter

As a maker
So that I can see what others are saying  
I want to see all peeps in reverse chronological order

As a Maker
So that I can better appreciate the context of a peep
I want to see the time at which it was made
```

```
Nouns:

chitter, peep, created_at
```

## 2. Infer the Table Name and Columns

Put the different nouns in this table. Replace the example with your own nouns.

| Record                | Properties          |
| --------------------- | ------------------  |
| chitter                 | peep, peep_time

Name of the table (always plural): `chitters` 

Column names: `peep`, `peep_time`

## 3. Decide the column types.

[Here's a full documentation of PostgreSQL data types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype.html).

Most of the time, you'll need either `text`, `int`, `bigint`, `numeric`, or `boolean`. If you're in doubt, do some research or ask your peers.

Remember to **always** have the primary key `id` as a first column. Its type will always be `SERIAL`.

```
# EXAMPLE:

id: SERIAL
peep: text
peep_time: time
```

## 4. Write the SQL.

```sql
-- EXAMPLE
-- file: chitters_table.sql

-- Replace the table name, columm names and types.

CREATE TABLE chitters (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  peep text,
  peep_time time
);
```

## 5. Create the table.

```bash
psql -h 127.0.0.1 chitter_database < chitters_table.sql
```
