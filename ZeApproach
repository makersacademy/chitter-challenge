# Notes n stuff


## First things first:

1) Install Gem files
2) Add config to spec helpers and curse bundler
3) check testing environment and write first useless but funny feature test
4) see it fail – RED
5) make it pass by cursing a bit more at bundler - GREEN


## Setting up database

1) Hard code data in controller
2) add view folder and index.erb file
3) set up spec for peep class – RED
4) create peep.rb file - GREEN
5) linked Peep class in controller, now making use of model - REFACTOR
6) setting up database & test database, making sure test database gets wiped


## User Story 1

```
As a Maker
So that I can let people know what I am doing
I want to post a message (peep) to chitter
```

1) setting up feature test, seeing it fail - RED
2) changing index.erb, adding button and specify new route
3) creating peeps/new.erb file with submit form
4) setting new route in controller, GET and POST
5) establishing connection to database - GREEN
6) REFACTOR so we use the model instead of the controller to deal with data


## User Story 2

```
As a maker
So that I can see what others are saying
I want to see all peeps in reverse chronological order
```

Done with 'ORDER BY time DESC'


## User Story 3

```
As a Maker
So that I can better appreciate the context of a peep
I want to see the time at which it was made
```

WHAT THE FUCK
