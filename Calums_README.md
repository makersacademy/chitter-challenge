In this challenge, I have followed a similar approach to that which we undertook in the weekly challenge of building a bookmark manager app.




### To set up the database

 Connect to `psql` and create the `peeps` database:

```
CREATE DATABASE peeps;
```

 To set up the appropriate tables, connect to the database in `psql` and run the SQL scripts in the `db/migrations` folder in the given order.
