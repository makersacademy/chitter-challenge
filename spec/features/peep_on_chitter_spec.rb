#As a Maker
#So that I can let people know what I am doing  
#I want to post a message (peep) to chitter

#As a maker
#So that I can see what others are saying  
#I want to see all peeps in reverse chronological order

#As a maker
#So that I can better appreciate the context of a peep
#I want to see the time at which it was made
