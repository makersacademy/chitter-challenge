## Chitter Challenge

A web application that allows users to post messages onto a Chitter page. The page is sorted in non-chronological order. The messages are stored on a database and is updated as users input their messages.

## Progress

Completed 3 of the 4 user stories. The user can send a peep that will show on the chitter page. The chitter messages are shown in a non chronological order and they show the time and date that they were posted.

If I had enough time I would implement the user sign up user story, and have the choice to sign out.
