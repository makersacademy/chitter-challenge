Users Model and Repository Classes Design Recipe
Copy this recipe template to design and implement Model and Repository classes for a database table.


1. Design and create the Table
If the table is already created in the database, you can skip this step.

Otherwise, follow this recipe to design and create the SQL schema for your table.

In this template, we will use an example table students

# EXAMPLE

Table: users

Columns:
id | name | username | email_address | password



2. Create Test SQL seeds
Your tests will depend on data stored in PostgreSQL to run.

If seed data is provided (or you already created it), you can skip this step.

# -- (file: spec/users_seeds.sql)
# -- Write your SQL seed here. 
# -- First, you would need to truncate the table - this is so our table is emptied between each test run,
# -- so we can start with a fresh state.
# -- (RESTART IDENTITY resets the primary key)

TRUNCATE TABLE users RESTART IDENTITY; -- replace with your own table name.

INSERT INTO users (name, user_name, email_address, password) VALUES ('Harry Potter', 'The boy who lives', 'harrypotter@gmail.com', 'goodday123');
INSERT INTO users (name, user_name, email_address, password) VALUES ('Ron Weasley', 'Ron.W', 'ronweasley@yahoo.com', 'RupertGrint95');


# Run this SQL file on the database to truncate (empty) the table, and insert the seed data. Be mindful of the fact any existing records in the table will be deleted.

# psql -h 127.0.0.1 your_database_name < seeds_{table_name}.sql


3. Define the class names
Usually, the Model class name will be the capitalised table name (single instead of plural). The same name is then suffixed by Repository for the Repository class name.

# EXAMPLE
# Table name: students

# Model class
# (in lib/album.rb)
class User
end

# Repository class
# (in lib/album_repository.rb)
class UserRepository
end



4. Implement the Model class
Define the attributes of your Model class. You can usually map the table columns to the attributes of the class, including primary and foreign keys.

# EXAMPLE
# Table name: albums

# Model class
# (in lib/album.rb)

class User

  # Replace the attributes by your own columns.
  attr_accessor :id, :name, :username, :email_address, :password
end

# The keyword attr_accessor is a special Ruby feature
# which allows us to set and get attributes on an object,
# here's an example:
#
# student = Student.new
# student.name = 'Jo'
# student.name
You may choose to test-drive this class, but unless it contains any more logic than the example above, it is probably not needed.



5. Define the Repository Class interface
Your Repository class will need to implement methods for each "read" or "write" operation you would like to run against the database.

Using comments, define the method signatures (arguments and return value) and what they do - write up the SQL queries that will be used by each method.

# EXAMPLE
# Table name: students

# Repository class
# (in lib/album_repository.rb)

class UserRepository

  # Selecting all records
  # No arguments
  def all
    # Executes the SQL query:
    # SELECT id, name, username, email_address, password FROM users;

    # Returns an array of Users objects.
  end

  def find(user_id)
    # Executes the SQL query:
    # SELECT id, name, username, email_address, password FROM users WHERE id = $1;


    # return a single User objects.
  end

  def create(user)
    # Executes the SQL query:
    # INSERT INTO users (name, username, email_address, password) VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4);

    # return a single User objects.
  end


  def delete(id)
    # Executes the SQL query:
    # DELETE users WHERE id = $1;

    # Returns nil
  end
end

6. Write Test Examples
Write Ruby code that defines the expected behaviour of the Repository class, following your design from the table written in step 5.

These examples will later be encoded as RSpec tests.

# EXAMPLES

# 1
# Get all users

repo = UserRepository.new

users = repo.all
users.length # => 2
users.first.name # => 'Harry Potter'
users.first.username # => 'The boy who lives'
users.first.email_address # => 'harrypotter@gmail.com'
users.first.password # => 'goodday123'



# 2
# Returns a single user ('Harry Potter')
repo = UserRepository.new
user = repo.find(1)

users.name # => 'Harry Potter'
users.username # => 'The boy who lives'
users.email_address # => 'harrypotter@gmail.com'
users.password # => 'goodday123'


# 3
# Returns a single user ('Ron Weasley')
repo = UserRepository.new
user = repo.find(2)

user.name # => 'Ron Weasley'
user.username # => 'Ron.W'
user.email_address # => 'ronweasley@yahoo.com'
user.password # => 'RupertGrint95'

# 4
# Create a new user ('Hermione Granger')
repo = UserRepository.new
new_user = repo.create

new_user.name = 'Hermione Granger'
new_user.username = 'HGranger'
new_user.email_address = 'hermioneg@hotmail.com'
new_user.password = 'Expelliarmus'

# 5
#deletes an account record
repo = UserRepository.new

id_to_delete = 1
repo.delete(id_to_delete)

all_users = repo.all  
all_users.length = # => 1
all_users.first.id = # => '2'



Encode this example as a test.

7. Reload the SQL seeds before each test run
Running the SQL code present in the seed file will empty the table and re-insert the seed data.

This is so you get a fresh table contents every time you run the test suite.

# EXAMPLE

# file: spec/student_repository_spec.rb

def reset_students_table
  seed_sql = File.read('spec/seeds_students.sql')
  connection = PG.connect({ host: '127.0.0.1', dbname: 'students' })
  connection.exec(seed_sql)
end

describe StudentRepository do
  before(:each) do 
    reset_students_table
  end

  # (your tests will go here).
end
8. Test-drive and implement the Repository class behaviour
After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour.
