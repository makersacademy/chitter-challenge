Posts Model and Repository Classes Design Recipe
Copy this recipe template to design and implement Model and Repository classes for a database table.


1. Design and create the Table
If the table is already created in the database, you can skip this step.

Otherwise, follow this recipe to design and create the SQL schema for your table.

In this template, we will use an example table students

# EXAMPLE

Table: posts

Columns:
id | message | time_created | user_id



2. Create Test SQL seeds
Your tests will depend on data stored in PostgreSQL to run.

If seed data is provided (or you already created it), you can skip this step.

# -- (file: spec/users_seeds.sql)
# -- Write your SQL seed here. 
# -- First, you would need to truncate the table - this is so our table is emptied between each test run,
# -- so we can start with a fresh state.
# -- (RESTART IDENTITY resets the primary key)

TRUNCATE TABLE posts RESTART IDENTITY; -- replace with your own table name.

INSERT INTO posts (message, time_created, user_id) VALUES ('Message 1', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, '1');
INSERT INTO posts (message, time_created, user_id) VALUES ('Message 2', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, '2');


# Run this SQL file on the database to truncate (empty) the table, and insert the seed data. Be mindful of the fact any existing records in the table will be deleted.

# psql -h 127.0.0.1 your_database_name < seeds_{table_name}.sql


3. Define the class names
Usually, the Model class name will be the capitalised table name (single instead of plural). The same name is then suffixed by Repository for the Repository class name.

# EXAMPLE
# Table name: students

# Model class
# (in lib/album.rb)
class Post
end

# Repository class
# (in lib/album_repository.rb)
class PostRepository
end



4. Implement the Model class
Define the attributes of your Model class. You can usually map the table columns to the attributes of the class, including primary and foreign keys.

# EXAMPLE
# Table name: posts

# Model class
# (in lib/post.rb)

class Post

  # Replace the attributes by your own columns.
  attr_accessor :id, :message, :time_created, :user_id
end

5. Define the Repository Class interface
Your Repository class will need to implement methods for each "read" or "write" operation you would like to run against the database.

Using comments, define the method signatures (arguments and return value) and what they do - write up the SQL queries that will be used by each method.

# Repository class
# (in lib/post_repository.rb)

class PostRepository

  # Selecting all records
  # No arguments
  def all
    # Executes the SQL query:
    # SELECT id, message, time_created, user_id FROM posts;

    # Returns an array of Posts objects.
  end

  def find(post)
    # Executes the SQL query:
    # SELECT id, message, time_created, user_id FROM posts WHERE id = $1;


    # return a single Post objects.
  end

  def create(post)
    # Executes the SQL query:
    # INSERT INTO posts (message, time_created, user_id) VALUES ($1, $2, $3);

    # return a single Post object.
  end

  def delete(id)
    # Executes the SQL query:
    # DELETE FROM post WHERE id = $1;

    # Returns nil
  end
end

6. Write Test Examples
Write Ruby code that defines the expected behaviour of the Repository class, following your design from the table written in step 5.

These examples will later be encoded as RSpec tests.

# EXAMPLES

# 1
# Get all users

repo = PostRepository.new

all_posts = repo.all
all_posts.length # => 2
all_posts.first.message # => 'If you want to know what a man’s like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals.'
all_posts.first.time_created # => '2023-01-15 17:31:10.871782'



# 2
# Returns a single post (1)
repo = PostRepository.new
post = repo.find(1)
post.message # => 'If you want to know what a man’s like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals.'
post.time_created # => '2023-01-15 17:31:10.871782'


# 3
# Returns a single post (2)
repo = PostRepository.new
user = repo.find(2)

post.message # => 'If you want to know what a man’s like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals.'
post.time_created # => '2023-01-15 17:31:10.876342'


# 4
# Create a new post ('Sadly, accidental rudeness occurs alarmingly often. Best to say nothing at all, my dear man.')
repo = PostRepository.new
new_post = repo.create

new_post.message = 'Sadly, accidental rudeness occurs alarmingly often. Best to say nothing at all, my dear man.'
new_post.time_created = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP

# 5
#deletes an account record
repo = PostRepository.new

id_to_delete = 1
repo.delete(id_to_delete)

all_users = repo.all  
all_users.length = # => 1
all_users.first.id = # => '2'



Encode this example as a test.

7. Reload the SQL seeds before each test run
Running the SQL code present in the seed file will empty the table and re-insert the seed data.

This is so you get a fresh table contents every time you run the test suite.

# EXAMPLE

# file: spec/student_repository_spec.rb

def reset_students_table
  seed_sql = File.read('spec/seeds_students.sql')
  connection = PG.connect({ host: '127.0.0.1', dbname: 'students' })
  connection.exec(seed_sql)
end

describe StudentRepository do
  before(:each) do 
    reset_students_table
  end

  # (your tests will go here).
end
8. Test-drive and implement the Repository class behaviour
After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour.
