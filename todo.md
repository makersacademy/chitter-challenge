- sort out tagged users
- change notes like 'you've logged out of your account' to flash notices rather than straight html
- find password protector gem to mix up password before saving in the hash
- check username and email are unique - not already in database
- refactor elements down into the model

- got really stuck on what was going wrong with my inner join to get the tags
