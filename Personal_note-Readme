My reflection on the Chitter-challenge.

I would like  to write about my development through the last and first
four weeks of Makers Academy.

My coding/programming skills definitely increased. Apart from that I'd rather
like to talk about my personal development.

When I arrived in London, six weeks ago, I was a different human.
My confidence level with code and overall life definitely increased. Facing
adversity is still a difficult task for me. It's way easier to deal with it when
I'm with people who work on the same project.

When I'm on my own and a problem comes up, I don't freak out anymore, but it
still takes me a long time to figure out what's wrong.

This weekend, I struggled especially with setting up the environment in the right
way. It took me quite a long time. The good thing with moments (or hours) like
this is, that it pushes myself to get better at it and at the same time I develop
as a human. I tended to push things that bother, hinder or bore me away, but in
this case, I have to get through the tough part to learn something, so, to achieve
my ultimate goal.

The file setup of my challenge is similar to the setup of our weekly challenge.
I find it more clearly and way better arranged than my previous three challenge
environment structures. It gives a more "professional" look on the first view.


It's 8:20 am on Monday. The pull request deadline is in 40 minutes.
I understand the work with databases, how they work and why they are so useful,
but I will have to invest more time in learning to work with them.
Especially when it comes to setting up the environment.

I am not happy with the outcome of this challenge. I am not satisfied at all.
In the book I am reading right now, it says, that life is just an endless chain
of problems and the solution to one problem always creates another problem.
I think it's the same with coding. And only by facing the problems you get a
solution. And solutions make you happy.
