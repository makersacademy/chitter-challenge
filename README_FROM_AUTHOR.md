ABOUT:		

The challenge is to build a Twitter clone as part of the Makers Academy course.

USER STORIES:

```sh
As a Maker
So that I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to sign up for Chitter

As a Maker
So that I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to log in to Chitter

As a Maker
So that I can avoid others posting messages on Chitter as me
I want to log out of Chitter

As a Maker
So that I can let people know what I am doing  
I want to post a message (peep) to chitter

As a maker
So that I can see what others are saying  
I want to see all peeps in reverse chronological order

As a maker
So that I can better appreciate the context of a peep
I want to see the time at which it was made

As a maker
In order to start a conversation as a maker I want to reply to a peep from another maker.
```

MY APPROACH:

I decided I wanted to extend functionality first and foremost before adding any front end design.

Sometimes the messages can be a bit zany and chatty - partly because that's what Makers is like.

The app is test driven with Capybara and Rspec.
The app uses Sinatra/Base and the modular style.

Unfortunately, the modular style can sometimes interact oddly with Rspec and Capybara, thus refactoring to a multiple-controller and central server setup is WIP and awaiting response form

FUNCTIONALITY, SCREEN SHOTS AND USAGE:

* Makers can sign up, sign in and log out.

```

```


* You cannot sign up if your username or password is not unique in the Postgresql database.

```


* You cannot sign in if your password doesn't match the one you signed up with.

```


* Passwords are encrypted with Bcrypt

* Non-Makers can see all users' peeps on the Chitter HQ page, but only site members can post peeps.

```

```


* Peeps are displayed in reverse chronological order and are stamped with the date, time and author of the peep.  

```

* Peep comments are seen in chronological order underneath peeps, stamped with their date, time and author.

TO DO

1. Understand how to get Sinatra and Rspec to work together in the modular style. Currently Rspec fires up Sinatra in the command line, and, when this is rectified, I cannot rackup the localhost site.

2. Further User stories
