I like that I managed to build the sign up/sign_in/sign_out system (even if I
don't completely understand how some stuff works).

I spent some time doing the styling, in the last challenge I was able to change
some fonts, background colours and images but was not comfortable with positioning
the objects. I did some basic positioning and aligning in this one (finished the
codecademy tutorial this time) and think it looks decent (in my screen at least).

I learned and implement a lot of new stuff while doing the challenge so it was
kind of hard to keep focusing on other things like keeping the code DRY or delegating
responsibilities in the right way, etc., (all the things I was focusing on the previews
week).

I would like to learn more about bcrypt and about sinatra's session_secret, in particular
how to store the key in an ENV variable.

I would like to have some feedback on the routes 'flow', meaning the way data is posted and
rendered, the number of erb files I used, etc. I think this could be improved in this 'app'.

Thanks!
