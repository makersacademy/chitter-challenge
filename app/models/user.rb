    # The Password.new returns an object that overrides the ==
    # method. Instead of comparing two passwords directly
    # (which is impossible because we only have a one-way hash)
    # the == method calculates the candidate password_digest from
    # the password given and compares it to the password_digest
    # it was initialised with.
    # So, to recap: THIS IS NOT A STRING COMPARISON
