Code review

Step 0 - tests:
  - All pass
  - App works
  - Labelling of tests is good
    - Reading this tells me .create does 2 things.... refactor possible?
    - user class could have improved readability... refactoring
    - what does the user class understand? I think it perhaps should be 2 classes
    - DRY out user class vs peep class. Maybe there should be a connection class?
    - self.database_connection exists in both classes and does exactly the same thing

Step 1 - progress:
 - only missing log out

 Step 2 - all good expect for:
 - Installation in the readme BUT doesn't work
 - "Want to load static assets such as CSS, images, and so on? Set a 'public folder' in your root, called 'static', then add the following configuration to your app.rb:"

 Step
 - split routes
