# Two Tables Design Recipe Template

_Copy this recipe template to design and create two related database tables from a specification._

## 1. Extract nouns from the user stories or specification

```
STRAIGHT UP

As a Maker
So that I can let people know what I am doing  
I want to post a message (peep) to chitter

As a maker
So that I can see what others are saying  
I want to see all peeps in reverse chronological order

As a Maker
So that I can better appreciate the context of a peep
I want to see the time at which it was made

As a Maker
So that I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to sign up for Chitter

HARDER

As a Maker
So that only I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to log in to Chitter

As a Maker
So that I can avoid others posting messages on Chitter as me
I want to log out of Chitter

ADVANCED

As a Maker
So that I can stay constantly tapped in to the shouty box of Chitter
I want to receive an email if I am tagged in a Peep
```

```md
# Extra info
 - Makers sign up to chitter with their email, password, name and a username.
 - The username and email are unique.
```

```
Nouns:

peep, message, time, sign up, accoun, email, password, name, username
```

## 2. Infer the Table Name and Columns

Put the different nouns in this table. Replace the example with your own nouns.

| Record                | Properties          |
| --------------------- | ------------------  |
| account               | email, password, name, username
| peep                  | message, time

1. Name of the first table (always plural): `accounts` 

    Column names: `email`, `password`, `name`, `username`

2. Name of the second table (always plural): `peeps` 

    Column names: `contents`, `time_posted`

## 3. Decide the column types.

[Here's a full documentation of PostgreSQL data types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype.html).

Most of the time, you'll need either `text`, `int`, `bigint`, `numeric`, or `boolean`. If you're in doubt, do some research or ask your peers.

Remember to **always** have the primary key `id` as a first column. Its type will always be `SERIAL`.

```
Table: accounts
id: SERIAL
email: text
password: text
name: text
username: text

Table: peeps
id: SERIAL
contents: text
time_posted: timestamp
```

## 4. Decide on The Tables Relationship

Most of the time, you'll be using a **one-to-many** relationship, and will need a **foreign key** on one of the two tables.

To decide on which one, answer these two questions:

1. Can one [TABLE ONE] have many [TABLE TWO]? (Yes/No)
2. Can one [TABLE TWO] have many [TABLE ONE]? (Yes/No)

You'll then be able to say that:

1. **[A] has many [B]**
2. And on the other side, **[B] belongs to [A]**
3. In that case, the foreign key is in the table [B]

Replace the relevant bits in this example with your own:

```
1. Can one account have several peeps? YES
2. Can one peep have several accounts? NO

So the foreign key should be in the peeps table
```

## 4. Write the SQL.

```sql
-- file: spec/chitter_tables.sql

-- Create the table without the foreign key first.
CREATE TABLE accounts (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  email text UNIQUE,
  password text,
  name text,
  username text UNIQUE
);

-- Then the table with the foreign key.
CREATE TABLE peeps (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  contents text,
  time_posted timestamp,
-- The foreign key name is always {other_table_singular}_id
  account_id int,
  constraint fk_account foreign key(account_id)
    references accounts(id)
    on delete cascade
);
```

## 5. Create the tables.

```bash
psql -h 127.0.0.1 chitter_db < chitter_tables.sql
```
