# Chitter - Two Tables Design Recipe Template

_Copy this recipe template to design and create two related database tables from a specification._

## 1. Extract nouns from the user stories or specification

```
STRAIGHT UP

As a Maker
So that I can let people know what I am doing  
I want to post a message (peep) to chitter

As a maker
So that I can see what others are saying  
I want to see all peeps in reverse chronological order

As a Maker
So that I can better appreciate the context of a peep
I want to see the time at which it was made

As a Maker
So that I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to sign up for Chitter

HARDER

As a Maker
So that only I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to log in to Chitter

As a Maker
So that I can avoid others posting messages on Chitter as me
I want to log out of Chitter

ADVANCED

As a Maker
So that I can stay constantly tapped in to the shouty box of Chitter
I want to receive an email if I am tagged in a Peep
```

```
Nouns:

post, message (peep), time, user, user_name, (tags - in many to many recipe)

```

## 2. Infer the Table Name and Columns

Put the different nouns in this table. Replace the example with your own nouns.

| Record                | Properties          |
| --------------------- | ------------------  |
| users                 | name, username, email, password
| posts                 | message (peep), time, tags
| comments              | coment, time

1. Name of the first table (always plural): `posts` 

    Column names: `peep`, `time`

2. Name of the second table (always plural): `comments` 

    Column names: `comment`, `time`

## 3. Decide the column types.

[Here's a full documentation of PostgreSQL data types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype.html).

Most of the time, you'll need either `text`, `int`, `bigint`, `numeric`, or `boolean`. If you're in doubt, do some research or ask your peers.

Remember to **always** have the primary key `id` as a first column. Its type will always be `SERIAL`.

```
Table: posts
id: SERIAL
peep: text
time: timestamp

Table: comments
id: SERIAL
comment: text
time: timestamp
```

## 4. Decide on The Tables Relationship

Most of the time, you'll be using a **one-to-many** relationship, and will need a **foreign key** on one of the two tables.

To decide on which one, answer these two questions:

1. Can one [TABLE ONE] have many [TABLE TWO]? (Yes/No)
2. Can one [TABLE TWO] have many [TABLE ONE]? (Yes/No)

You'll then be able to say that:

1. **[A] has many [B]**
2. And on the other side, **[B] belongs to [A]**
3. In that case, the foreign key is in the table [B]

Replace the relevant bits in this example with your own:

```
# EXAMPLE

1. Can one post have many comments? YES
2. Can one comment have many posts? NO

-> Therefore,
-> An post HAS MANY comments
-> An comment BELONGS TO an post

-> Therefore, the foreign key is on the comment table.
```

*If you can answer YES to the two questions, you'll probably have to implement a Many-to-Many relationship, which is more complex and needs a third table (called a join table).*

## 4. Write the SQL.

```sql
-- file: seeds.sql

CREATE TABLE posts (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  peep text,
  time timestamp,
  user_id int,
  constraint fk_user foreign key(user_id)
    references users(id)
    on delete cascade
);

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS comments CASCADE;

CREATE TABLE comments (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    comment text,
    time timestamp,
    post_id int,
    constraint fk_post foreign key(post_id)
        references posts(id)
        on delete cascade
);

```

## 5. Create the tables.

```bash
psql -h 127.0.0.1 database_name < seeds.sql
```
