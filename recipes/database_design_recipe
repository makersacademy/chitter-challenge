Two Tables Design Recipe Template
Copy this recipe template to design and create two related database tables from a specification.

1. Extract nouns from the user stories or specification

As a Maker
So that I can let people know what I am doing  
I want to post a message (peep) to chitter

As a maker
So that I can see what others are saying  
I want to see all peeps in reverse chronological order

As a Maker
So that I can better appreciate the context of a peep
I want to see the time at which it was made

As a Maker
So that I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to sign up for Chitter

Nouns: peep, time, user, email, username, password

A user can have many peeps, therefore a peep belongs to a user so the foreign key belongs in the peeps table.

CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name text,
  username text,
  email text,
  password text
);

CREATE TABLE peeps (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  title text,
  content text,
  user_id int,
  constraint fk_user foreign key (user_id)
    references users(id)
    on delete cascade
);

5. Create the tables.
psql -h 127.0.0.1 chitter < chitter_tables
