Database setup:
-------
- Connect to psql
- Create the database using the psql command `CREATE DATABASE chitter;`
- Connect to the database using the pqsl command `\c chitter;`
- Run the query saved in './db/migrations/create_chitter_table.sql'

```
Notes on functionality:
------

* You don't have to be logged in to see the peeps.
* Makers sign up to chitter with their email, password, name and a username (e.g. samm@makersacademy.com, password123, Sam Morgan, sjmog).
* The username and email are unique.
* Peeps (posts to chitter) have the name of the maker and their user handle.
* Your README should indicate the technologies used, and give instructions on how to install and run the tests.

Bonus:
-----

If you have time you can implement the following:

* In order to start a conversation as a maker I want to reply to a peep from another maker.

And/Or:

* Work on the CSS to make it look good.

Good luck and let the chitter begin!

Code Review
-----------

In code review we'll be hoping to see:

* All tests passing
* High [Test coverage](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/test_coverage.md) (>95% is good)
* The code is elegant: every class has a clear responsibility, methods are short etc.

Reviewers will potentially be using this [code review rubric](docs/review.md).  Referring to this rubric in advance may make the challenge somewhat easier.  You should be the judge of how much challenge you want this weekend.

Notes on test coverage
----------------------

Please ensure you have the following **AT THE TOP** of your spec_helper.rb in order to have test coverage stats generated
on your pull request:

```ruby
require 'simplecov'
require 'simplecov-console'

SimpleCov.formatter = SimpleCov::Formatter::MultiFormatter.new([
  SimpleCov::Formatter::Console,
  # Want a nice code coverage website? Uncomment this next line!
  # SimpleCov::Formatter::HTMLFormatter
])
SimpleCov.start
```

You can see your test coverage when you run your tests. If you want this in a graphical form, uncomment the `HTMLFormatter` line and see what happens!
