# Chitter - A Twitter clone
#### (Makers Academy Week 4 - Weekend challenge)

- Users can sign up for an account and then post Peeps to the public stream.

- Peeps can only be posted when a user is logged in.

- The peeps are displayed in reverse chronological order and each one shows the time at which it was posted along with the user who wrote it.
