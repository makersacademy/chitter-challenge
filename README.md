What is it?
---------

Chitter challenge is a simple clone of the famous website Twitter.
Technologies used: Ruby/Sinatra, datamapper, postgresql, Capybara/RSpec for TDD,
Bootstrap/CSS for some styling and Mailgun API to send emails.
A user creates an account and then he can post a peep(tweet),
he can reply to other peeps and view all the replies.

Build Process
-----

Used TDD with Capybara/RSpec, implemented all aspects of a basic authentication
from scratch, Signup, Login, Forgot password with token generation send via
email, also the token expires after an hour and gets deleted if they use it.
Used Bootstrap CSS for fast and easy css styling.
Separated my DBs to test and development, to isolate tests from the actual data.
Used database cleaner gem for my test environment, to ensure every test has a
clean database. Used the BCrypt gem to handle the password encryption.
