Chitter Challenge
==================


![id](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Corina/chitter-challenge/master/public/Screen%20Shot.png)


Chitter is a web app where users can post short messages and view messages posted by other people. In order to be able to post you need to create an account. The home page lists all *peeps* created up until now, in reverse chronological order, including user and timestamp for each *peep*.

In order to create an account you have to specify email, password, user name and name, with email and user name restricted to unique values.

Style elements were added using Bootstrap framework. Heroku was used for production deployment.
