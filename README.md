Code Review
-----------

In code review we'll be hoping to see:

* All tests passing
* High [Test coverage](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/test_coverage.md) (>95% is good)
* The code is elegant: every class has a clear responsibility, methods are short etc.

Reviewers will potentially be using this [code review rubric](docs/review.md).  Referring to this rubric in advance may make the challenge somewhat easier.  You should be the judge of how much challenge you want this weekend.

# How I Found This Challenge
----

I really enjoyed this weekend challenge and implementing a twitter clone. I found that I needed to rely on looking at my materials from last week (bookmark challenge) quite a lot but I'm ok with that as I feel I have become better as a result. I would like to get more into the HTML, style and presentation of the work but I know this is something that I can work on at other times. I was really pleased to deploy my app to heroku and for it to work on there too.
