#Chitter Challenge#

This is the challenge from the end of the 4th week at Makers Academy. The challenge is to make a 'chitter' application, allowing makers to post short messages to a message board.

```sh
As a Maker
So that I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to sign up for Chitter

As a Maker
So that I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to log in to Chitter

As a Maker
So that I can avoid others posting messages on Chitter as me
I want to log out of Chitter

As a maker
So that I can let people know what I am doing
I want to post a message (peep) to chitter

As a maker
So that I can see what others are saying
I want to see all peeps in reverse chronological order
```
