Technical Approach:
-----



Notes on functionality:
------

* You don't have to be logged in to see the peeps.
* Makers sign up to chitter with their email, password, name and a username (e.g. samm@makersacademy.com, password123, Sam Morgan, sjmog).
* The username and email are unique.
* Peeps (posts to chitter) have the name of the maker and their user handle.
* Your README should indicate the technologies used, and give instructions on how to install and run the tests.
