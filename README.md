Chitter Challenge
=================

To install this Repo simple git clone and install.
You will need to follow the steps within db/migrations to set up a db that can talk to this app.
you will also need to ```bundle install``` once you have created the db.

Once you have done this you will be able to use Chitter.

To run Chitter, got to terminal and within the directory type:
```rackup```
this should auto rack up the app on a localhost giving you a port number.

To user Chitter you will need to create an account by signing up, at which point you will gain access to all Peeps and be able to post your own.

Happy Chitter'ing!
