This is my first attempt at the Chitter challenge.
I followed the tutorial we did on Bookmark Manager and tried to recreate the same with Chitter. 
At this point, there are still some aspects which are unclear so I'm spending time understanding what I'm doing, while following the tutorial.
I have not finished the challenge and plan to carry on, on Monday. I also plan to redo it in revision week.


Chitter Challenge
=================

* Challenge time: Friday afternoon (+ weekend if you need it)
* Feel free to use google, your notes, books, etc but work on your own
* You must submit a pull request to this repo with your code by 9am Monday morning

Challenge:
-------

As usual please start by 

* Filling out your learning plan self review for the week: https://github.com/makersacademy/learning_plan (if you haven't already)
* Forking this repo

We are going to write a little Twitter clone that will allow the users to post messages to a public stream.

I want to see all peeps in reverse chronological order
```

Notes on functionality:
------

* Drive the creation of your app using tests - either cucumber or rspec as you prefer
* Makers sign up to chitter with their email, password, name and a user name (e.g. sam@makersacademy.com, s3cr3t, Samuel Russell Hampden Joseph, tansaku).
* The username and email are unique.
* Peeps (posts to chitter) have the name of the maker and their user handle.
* Use bcrypt to secure the passwords.
* Use data mapper and postgres to save the data.
* You don't have to be logged in to see the peeps.
* You only can peep if you are logged in.
* Please ensure that you update your README to indicate the technologies used, and give instructions on how to install and run the tests
* Finally submit a pull request before Monday at 9am with your solution or partial solution.  However much or little amount of code you wrote please please please submit a pull request before Monday at 9am

Bonus:
-----

If you have time you can implement the following:

* In order to start a conversation as a maker I want to reply to a peep from another maker.

And/Or:

* Work on the css to make it look good (we all like beautiful things).

Good luck and let the chitter begin!
