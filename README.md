Challenge:

As usual please start by forking this repo.

We are going to write a small Twitter clone that will allow the users to post messages to a public stream.

```
STRAIGHT UP

As a Maker
So that I can let people know what I am doing  
I want to post a message (peep) to chitter

As a maker
So that I can see what others are saying  
I want to see all peeps in reverse chronological order

As a Maker
So that I can better appreciate the context of a peep
I want to see the time at which it was made

As a Maker
So that I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to sign up for Chitter

HARDER

As a Maker
So that only I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to log in to Chitter

As a Maker
So that I can avoid others posting messages on Chitter as me
I want to log out of Chitter

ADVANCED

As a Maker
So that I can stay constantly tapped in to the shouty box of Chitter
I want to receive an email if I am tagged in a Peep
```

Notes on functionality:
------

* You don't have to be logged in to see the peeps.
* Makers sign up to chitter with their email, password, name and a username (e.g. samm@makersacademy.com, password123, Sam Morgan, sjmog).
* The username and email are unique.
* Peeps (posts to chitter) have the name of the maker and their user handle.
* Your README should indicate the technologies used, and give instructions on how to install and run the tests.

Bonus:
-----
If you have time you can implement the following:
* In order to start a conversation as a maker I want to reply to a peep from another maker.
And/Or:
* Work on the CSS to make it look good.

How to install:

bundle install
only need to create chitter and chitter_test databases - everything else is done in setup_test_db for rspec tests
run by using `rackup`.

TODO:
Plan out web layout with different pages and actions
Display all peeps on homepage in reverse order with name, username and time created.
Add peeps - rename messages table?
sign up - creates a new user --- email and username must be unique!

Can sign in with username or email with their password - detects if there's an @ in field when checking in DB.
