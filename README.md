As a maker
So that I can better appreciate the context of a peep

```

I use Sinatra, bcrypt to make password, datamapper to work with database.
For tests I use capybara, factory_girl, database_cleaner.

I have two classes, User and Peep, they are connected one-to-many (user can have many peeps, peep belongs to one user).
Website structure is the following:
```
/
/peeps
/peeps/new
/session
/session/new
/user
/user/new
```
