Chitter Challenge
=================

This challenge was forked from [Maker Academy Chitter Challenge](https://github.com/makersacademy/chitter-challenge). The challenge was to build a clone of Twitter! To do so, the following user stories were given:

```
As a Maker
So that I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to sign up for Chitter

As a Maker
So that I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to log in to Chitter

As a Maker
So that I can avoid others posting messages on Chitter as me
I want to log out of Chitter

As a Maker
So that I can let people know what I am doing  
I want to post a message (peep) to chitter

As a maker
So that I can see what others are saying  
I want to see all peeps in reverse chronological order

As a maker
So that I can better appreciate the context of a peep
I want to see the time at which it was made

```
To build the website I used the ```sinatra```and ```rackup``` gems to build, ```rspec``` and ```capybara``` to test, and ```DataMapper``` to communicate with a PostgreSQL database. The web app is hosted by [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and can be visited at https://chitterchattering.herokuapp.com/. The user can sign up or sign in to post a message which can be viewed by all on the homepage.
