Challenge:
-------

To write a small Twitter clone that will allow the users to post messages to a public stream.

Current Progress:
-------

My app currently allows you the user to
- post peeps
- view "peeps" in reverse chronological order (stating how long ago the peep was posted)

Features yet to implement
- ability to create an account
- ability to log in to and log out of your account
