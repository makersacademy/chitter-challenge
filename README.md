Chitter Challenge
=================

Summary:
-------

Week 4 Makers Academy weekend project. To write a small Twitter clone that will allow the users to post messages to a public stream. [Full instructions can be found here](https://github.com/makersacademy/chitter-challenge).

-----

Functionality:
-----
* Integrated a database of posts ('peeps') and usernames into Chitter using the `PG` gem and `SQL` queries.
* Built feature and unit tests with Capybara and RSpec.
* Users can peep and see time of their post
* Users can sign up

-----

Improvements needed:
------

* Ensuring users with existing accounts cannot sign up
* Peeps won't post if they have apostrophes in them – need to fix this
* Allow users to log in and log out
* CSS!
