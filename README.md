# User stories

As a Maker
So that I can let people know what I am doing  
I want to post a message (peep) to chitter

[x]
As a maker
So that I can see what others are saying  
I want to see all peeps in reverse chronological order

[x]
As a Maker
So that I can better appreciate the context of a peep
I want to see the time at which it was made
