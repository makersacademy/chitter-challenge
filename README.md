As usual please start by 

* Filling out your learning plan self review for the week: https://github.com/makersacademy/learning_plan (if you haven't already)

We are going to write a little Twitter clone that will allow the users to post messages to a public stream.

Features:

* In order to use chitter as a maker I want to sign up to the service
* In order to user chitter as a maker I want to log in
* In order to avoid others using my account as a maker I want to log out
* In order to let people know what I am doing as a maker I want to post a message (peep) to chitter
* In order to see what people have to say as a maker I want to see all peeps in chronological order

Notes:
------

* Makers sign up to chitter with their email, password, name and a user name (e.g. sam@makersacademy.com, s3cr3t, Samuel Russell Hampden Joseph, tansaku).
* The username and email are unique.
* Peeps (posts to chitter) have the name of the maker and their user handle.
* Use bcrypt to secure the passwords.
* Use data mapper and postgres to save the data.
* You don't have to be logged in to see the peeps.
* You only can peep if you are logged in.
* Finally submit a pull request before Monday at 9am with your solution or partial solution.  However much or little amount of code you wrote please please please submit a pull request before Monday at 9am

Bonus:

If you have time you can implement the following:

* In order to start a conversation as a maker I want to reply to a peep from another maker.

Good luck and let the chitter begin!
