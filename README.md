# Chitter Challenge

This program allows users to visit Chitter, view all peeps, sign up for a Chitter account, and post a peep.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Installing

Clone the program to your local directory and run:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ker-an/chitter-challenge.git
$ bundle install
$ createdb chitter_development
$ rspec
$ rackup
```

## Built with

```
BCrypt
Capybara
Database Cleaner
DataMapper 1.2.0
RSpec
Ruby 2.4.0
Sinatra
```

## Final Thoughts

While I was unable to finish the program to include a log in (User Story 5), log out (User Story 6) and email notification (User Story 7) feature, I learned a lot from working through this assignment. I found Week 4 content to be challenging and took some time this weekend understanding the various concepts. If given more time, I would have added the missing features and made the program look nice.
