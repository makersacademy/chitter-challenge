# RPS Challenge

The RPS challenge is the fourth weekend challenge at Makers Academy. The request
was to build a little Twitter clone that would allow the users to post messages
to a public stream.. The instructions can be found in the "INSTRUCTIONS.md" file.

The app was built using Test Driven Development supported by Rspec and Capybara.

Other technologies used:

* Ruby
* DattaMapper
* Postgres
* Sinatra
* Bcrypt
