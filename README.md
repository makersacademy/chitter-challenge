Chitter Challenge
=================

* Challenge time: rest of the day and weekend, until Monday 9am
* Feel free to use google, your notes, books, etc. but work on your own
* If you refer to the solution of another coach or student, please put a link to that in your README
* If you have a partial solution, **still check in a partial solution**
* You must submit a pull request to this repo with your code by 9am Monday morning

Challenge:
-------

As usual please start by forking this repo.

We are going to write a little Twitter clone that will allow the users to post messages to a public stream.

Features:
-------

```

I want to sign up for Chitter

As a Maker

As a Maker
So that I can let people know what I am doing

I want to see all peeps in reverse chronological order

As a maker
So that I can better appreciate the context of a peep
I want to see the time at which it was made
```

Notes on functionality:
------

ensure that Ruby 2.3.1 is in use
bundle install
run the app using the command 'ruby ./app/app.rb' on the command line
run the local host on your web browser
To begin using Chitter, the user must Sign Up (assuming they haven't before)
You click the Sign up button and enter the correct credentials (the e-mail must be complete, in correct format and the passwords must match)
Once signed up, the user will be automatically signed in and be able to enter a Peep (Chitter's version of Tweet)


Bonus:
-----


Code Review
-----------

In code review we'll be hoping to see:

* All tests passing
* High [Test coverage](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/test_coverage.md) (>95% is good)
* The code is elegant: every class has a clear responsibility, methods are short etc. 

Reviewers will potentially be using this [code review rubric](docs/review.md).  Referring to this rubric in advance may make the challenge somewhat easier.  You should be the judge of how much challenge you want this weekend.

Notes on test coverage
----------------------

Please ensure you have the following **AT THE TOP** of your spec_helper.rb in order to have test coverage stats generated
on your pull request:

```ruby
require 'coveralls'
require 'simplecov'

SimpleCov.formatters = [
  SimpleCov::Formatter::HTMLFormatter,
  Coveralls::SimpleCov::Formatter
]
Coveralls.wear! 
```

You can see your [test coverage](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/test_coverage.md) when you submit a pull request, and you can also get a summary locally by running:

```
$ coveralls report
```

This repo works with [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/) to calculate test coverage statistics on each pull request.
