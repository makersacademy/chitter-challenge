Chitter application
==================

Introduction
-------
The Chitter application is the third weekend challenge at the Makers Academy in London. The challenge was to build an application that could handle a user sign up system that would allow users to post peeps and comments to each other. I have built the application in a test driven approach using rspec and Capybara. I built my application via the Sinatra framework and the intent was to implement techniques related to relational database mapping. I have used DataMapper and Postgres as the adapter to set up my database. I have added client and database validation to the application and conditional routing to my controller in order to enhance user security.
I have implemented the MailGun API to allow for password recovery.
