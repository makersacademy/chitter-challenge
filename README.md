# Squiggler: Twitter but for squirrels

Built for a Makers weekend challenge

In squiggle one can
- create an account
- login to your account
- logout of your account
- post a "squiggle"
- view everyone's squiggles
- tag and delete your (and only your) squiggles
- filter posts by tag  
- view squiggles in "nuttified" format ğŸŒ°ğŸŒ°ğŸŒ°ğŸŒ°

To set up
```sh
git clone (repository-url)
bundle
rake setup
```

When you're done
```sh
rake teardown
```
Rake will create and destroy the database tables as necessary
