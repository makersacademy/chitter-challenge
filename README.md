STRAIGHT UP

As a Maker
So that I can let people know what I am doing  
I want to post a message (peep) to chitter

As a maker
So that I can see what others are saying  
I want to see all peeps in reverse chronological order

As a Maker
So that I can better appreciate the context of a peep
I want to see the time at which it was made

As a Maker
So that I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to sign up for Chitter

HARDER

As a Maker
So that only I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to log in to Chitter

As a Maker
So that I can avoid others posting messages on Chitter as me
I want to log out of Chitter

ADVANCED

As a Maker
So that I can stay constantly tapped in to the shouty box of Chitter
I want to receive an email if I am tagged in a Peep
```

Notes on functionality:
------

* You don't have to be logged in to see the peeps.
* Makers sign up to chitter with their email, password, name and a username (e.g. samm@makersacademy.com, password123, Sam Morgan, sjmog).
* The username and email are unique.
* Peeps (posts to chitter) have the name of the maker and their user handle.

* PostgreSQL as the database
* WEBrick as the web server
* HTML for structuring the web pages
* CSS for  styling the web pages
* Render as the cloud platform for deploying the web application

Instruction on how to install and run the tests:

```bash
$ gem install bundler
```

4. Use Bundler to install all necessary packages: # install all the packages in the gem file

```bash
$ bundle install
```

5. create the database for testing:

```bash
$ createdb chitter_database_testing
```

6. import SQL script file into the PostgreSQL database:

```bash
$ psql -h 127.0.0.1 createdb chitter_database_testing < chitter_tables.sql
```

7. execute `rspec` to run the tests:

Further development:
------
* encrypt password information
* add more validation on peep messages, making sure it does not include offensive content.
* add proper validation on email-address during sign-up, making sure that it does exist
* have a delete functionality on posted messages
* have a  delete account functionality on existing users
* be able to reply/comment to a posted peep
* add more links to navigate web-app easier
