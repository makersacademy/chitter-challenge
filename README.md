#TwitTwoo

A completely original idea for the 21st century.

##What is it?

TwitTwoo - inspired by the noise that two owls make in communication - is an electronically telephonically connected way for users (owls) to send (twit) messages to others, who can then reply (twoo).

##How do I set it up?

Simply head to the sign up page, enter your name, address, desired username and password. But be quick, because once a username has been issued it's gone, also think carefully about it, as you can only hace one username per person.

##How do I use it?

You can write twits on your page (nest) or twoo to other owls' twits in their nests.

##Is it fun?

Yes.

##Why should I sign up?

If you want to be accepted and included in society this is the only way.
