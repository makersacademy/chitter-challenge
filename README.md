Chitter
=======

This is a simple Twitter clone, allowing users to post messages (peeps) on their profile page and for users and non logged-in users to view everyone's peeps by going to their user page. This is built using [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) and [Postgres](http://www.postgresql.org/). Tests are written in [Rspec](http://rspec.info/) and [Capybara](http://jnicklas.github.io/capybara/). Used [bcrypt](https://github.com/codahale/bcrypt-ruby) to secure the passwords and [data mapper](http://datamapper.org/) to save the data to the Postgres database.

Getting Started
---------------

I work off a vagrant VM whose Vagrantfile you can find [here](https://github.com/DataMinerUK/MakersAcademy-VM). So when running this from the VM, put the Vagrantfile in the chitter directory and:

On the command line
```bash
vagrant up # This may take a while
sudo -i -u postgres
createuser -drS vagrant
createdb chitter_test
createdb chitter_development
exit
vagrant ssh
cd /vagrant
cd [where_ever_happens_to_be]/chitter
bundle install
```
To check run the version locally
```bash
rackup -p4567 --host 0.0.0.0
```
and go to localhost:4567 on your machine.
