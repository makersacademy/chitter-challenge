So that I can let people know what I am doing

As a maker

I want to see all peeps in reverse chronological order

As a Maker
So that I can better appreciate the context of a peep

User story one was completed by creating a database using SQL and connecting it to a Ruby app structure using Data mapper.

User story two was completed by reversing the entries once they were taken out of the database.

User story three was completed by adding the time as a property to the Data mapper Chit model.

User story four was completed by using bcrypt to take an email and password and encrypt the password securely in a database.

CSS was added by adding a public folder to the app and creating stylesheets for each view.
