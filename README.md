Chitter Challenge
=================

J Sheps report: I completed all the basic implementation on Saturday including validity and uniqueness of email/username.
On Sunday there was an issue with validation (for some reason, I still don't know what) and so I reverted to an old commit and slowly reintroduced the code.  I spent 4 hours on Sunday morning trying this and the only 45mins that was worthwhile was narrowing it down to validation.  The 2nd version passed all the tests and worked locally despite the code being identical and my databases having been wiped several times.  There were a lot of tears and frustration and I basically hated my life most of the day.

I still plan to implement sign in/sign out but this will have to wait. I also want it to say who wrote the peeps.
