Chitter README

This is my very very basic version of Chitter. Users can hit signup to sign up. Once they are signed up, they can post 'Peeps' and view other users peeps. When they sign out, they are still able to view peeps just unable to post. Nothing fancy.

If you would like to see this amazing app in action, go to the heroku link here: https://chitter-challenge-nick.herokuapp.com/
