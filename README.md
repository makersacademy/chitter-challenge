Implementation:
-------
Chitter challenge was implemented with the complete set of user stories
described below using TDD and RSpec driving the design. The application is built with Ruby and Sinatra, with user
accounts and peeps (in a one-to-many relationship) stored in a Postgresql relational database with DataMapper as
the chosen ORM. The live development web application is hosted by Heroku, and
can be viewed at:

[https://chitter-ggwc82.herokuapp.com/](https://chitter-ggwc82.herokuapp.com/).

Peeps can be viewed by all users, whether signed in or not. In order to peep, a
user must be signed in with a valid account. Users can sign up, sign in and sign
out. Implementation of validations of form input takes place at a rudimentary
level at the view level with HTML5, however more robust methods are enabled at
the model level utilizing DataMapper, which handles a range of authentication of
user credentials.

DataMapper validations for account creation include checking for valid email address
input, duplicates and mismatches between password and confirmation password. For
signing in, users are required to enter both email and password correctly for an
existing account.

Error messages are raised in the above mentioned cases using Sinatra Flash, and user password
encryption is handled by BCrypt. User sign outs are implemented via a DELETE
request, which relies on an MethodOverride function within Rack to provide this
functionality. 


Instructions:
-------

a). Front page. We first need to sign up for an account.

![sign up](/img/1.png?raw=true) 
-----------------

b). If an invalid email is submitted, a user error will be raised.

![invalid email error](/img/2.png?raw=true) 
 -----------------

c). If the password and confirmation password do not match, an error is raised.

![password mismatch error](/img/3.png?raw=true) 
 -----------------

d). Successfully signed up, and auto signed in. You can now peep.

![successful sign up and sign in](/img/4.png?raw=true) 
 -----------------

e). Peep is submitted, and now appears in the current view.

![submitted peep](/img/5.png?raw=true) 
 -----------------

f). Successfully signed out, and can still view peeps, but cannot submit new
   peep.

![successful sign out](/img/6.png?raw=true) 
 -----------------

g). An unsucessful attempt at signing in with incorrect user credentials.

![unsuccesful sign in attempt](/img/7.png?raw=true) 
 -----------------

h). Logged back in again, peeped second time to show reverse chronological order
   and persisting of previous peeps.
