As a maker
So that I can see what others are saying  
I want to see all peeps in reverse chronological order

As a maker
So that I can better appreciate the context of a peep
I want to see the time at which it was made

```

Notes on functionality:
------

* Peeps (posts to chitter) have the name of the maker and their user handle.
* You don't have to be logged in to see the peeps.
* You only can peep if you are logged in.
* In order to start a conversation as a maker I want to reply to a peep from another maker.
* Work on the css to make it look good (we all like beautiful things).
