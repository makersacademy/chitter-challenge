# Chitter Challenge

This project is one of the solo projects during the study at Makers. By combining all the skills I learnt from previous weeks, I was aksed to clone Twitter with test-driven approach and object-oriented design. `Ruby`, `Postgresql`, `RSpec`, `Sinetra`, `Active Record` and `Figma` will be used in this project.

I took `Twitter` as the blueprint of this app. Users have to login in order to read peeps from others or create a peep.
