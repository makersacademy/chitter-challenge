Chitter Challenge
=================

This is the weekend challenge for week 4 of the Makers Academy bootcamp.
The challenge to write a small Twitter clone that will allow the users to post messages to a public stream.

I don't feel very good about this one. 
I found it really hard, and I spent a pretty long time trying (and failing) to get the username to appear under a tweet
\- there are a few bits of shrapnel left over from my shoddy attempts in the code that I haven't had time
to clean up yet.

I haven't had time to add any css either :( 

How to use:

Open psql in your terminal and run the database migrations in order.

Run bundle install and rackup in your terminal, then go to localhost:9292 in your browser.

Peep away!
