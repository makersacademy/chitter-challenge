Notes on functionality
------

* This app has been created using Rspec for BDD, TDD purposes.
* Makers sign up to chitter with their email, password, name and a user name (e.g.  joe_bloggs@makers.com, sdf3t, Joe Bloggs, big_joey).
* The username and email are unique.
* Peeps (posts to chitter) have the name of the maker and their user handle.
* Used bcrypt to secure the passwords.
* Used data mapper and postgres to save the data.
* You don't have to be logged in to see the peeps.
* You only can peep if you are logged in.
