Chitter Challenge
=================

Weekend 4 challenge is to write a little Twitter clone named 'Chitter' that will allow the users to post messages (peep) to a public stream.

Notes on technologies:
------

* Capybara
* RSpec
* Sinatra
* DataMapper as ORM
* Rake
* BCrypt to hash user password


##Installation instructions:
-------------------------
1. git clone https://github.com/littlethao/chitter-challenge.git
2. bundle install
3. psql postgres => CREATE DATABASE chitter_development;
4. rake db:auto_migrate RACK_ENV=development
5. rspec
6. ruby app/app.rb
7. Visit in your browser: http://localhost:4567/peeps


Notes on further steps
----------------------
Currently, there is no link from the home path '/' to other paths of this app as yet. Further implementation also required on the visual layout and response functionality, and finally, refactoring is still needed for skinny controllers. These are steps, I'd wish to take to finalise this project.
