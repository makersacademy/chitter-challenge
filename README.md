Challenge:
-------


```
STRAIGHT UP

As a Maker
So that I can let people know what I am doing  
I want to post a message (peep) to chitter

As a maker
So that I can see what others are saying  
I want to see all peeps in reverse chronological order

As a Maker
So that I can better appreciate the context of a peep
I want to see the time at which it was made

As a Maker
So that I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to sign up for Chitter

HARDER

As a Maker
So that only I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to log in to Chitter

As a Maker
So that I can avoid others posting messages on Chitter as me
I want to log out of Chitter

ADVANCED

As a Maker
So that I can stay constantly tapped in to the shouty box of Chitter
I want to receive an email if I am tagged in a Peep
```



Bonus:
-----

If you have time you can implement the following:

* In order to start a conversation as a maker I want to reply to a peep from another maker.

And/Or:

* Work on the css to make it look good (we all like beautiful things).

Good luck and let the chitter begin!
