## Bookmark Reference Work Through

### Skipped / Still To Do

09 set up datamapper table object (link in this case)
10 And set erb in relation to viewing links
11 set up test and form to create link (ie a peep for us)
15 Adding tags - test, erb, model, controller
16 filtering by tag - tests, route patterns, has n update to model
17 multiple tags - tests, controller, use of rakefile on Cmd line

### Done

12 Set up database cleaner
  todo lines 42-45 in spec_helper - may work once data in db?
13 config.ru, DataMapper.setup(...) datamapper_setup, app.rb, spec_helper.rb
14 Heroku
