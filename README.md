Technical Approach:
-----

[Link to process](process/user_stories/README.md)

Notes on functionality:
------

- [X] You don't have to be logged in to see the peeps.
- [X] Makers sign up to chitter with their email, password, name and a username (e.g. samm@makersacademy.com, password123, Sam Morgan, sjmog).
- [ ] The username and email are unique.
- [X] (Half complete)Peeps (posts to chitter) have the name of the maker and their user handle.
- [ ] Your README should indicate the technologies used, and give instructions on how to install and run the tests.

Bonus:
-----

If you have time you can implement the following:

- [ ] In order to start a conversation as a maker I want to reply to a peep from another maker.

And/Or:

- [ ] Work on the CSS to make it look good.

Good luck and let the chitter begin!
