As a maker
So that I can see what others are saying

I want to see the time at which it was made

As a Maker
So that I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to sign up for Chitter


As a Maker

Notes on functionality:
------

* Creation of the app uses TDD
* Use data mapper and postgres to save the data.
* You don't have to be logged in to see the peeps.
* Makers sign up to chitter with their email, password, name and a user name (e.g. sam@makersacademy.com, s3cr3t, Samuel Russell Hampden Joseph, tansaku).
* You only can peep if you are logged in.
----

Next steps:
------
* Encryption of the passwords
* Error messages around password confirmation
* Notifying users of tagged peeps
