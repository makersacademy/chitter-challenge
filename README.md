Functionality:
------

* You don't have to be logged in to see the peeps.
* Makers sign up to chitter with their email, password, name and a username (e.g. samm@makersacademy.com, password123, Sam Morgan, sjmog).
* The username and email are unique.
* Peeps (posts to chitter) have the name of the maker and their user handle.
* Your README should indicate the technologies used, and give instructions on how to install and run the tests.



Design Choices:
-----

I took this challenge as an opportunity to brush up on using containers without Bootstrap or any library, as this was always something I found quite difficult.

Extra challenge I've set myself: Having no Photoshop on this Makers MacBook (I unfortunately had to bury mine), I made use of other software like Affinity Photo and Figma for prototyping and basic edits. Will properly re-edit later.

My first idea was to get as far away from the normal Twitter as possible and to create some sort of secret club, thus the color choices and the picture with the girl, including a landing page which you can see here:

While I was coding the website I changed my mind through and switched to a design that was closely inspired by Twitter.
The colour palette I've used is the exact same as Twitters' dark mode. To keep some sort of link to my first prototype, I've kept the lock logo to refer to it. Instead for going for a cartoonish looking bird like in the original, I decided to go a bit more realistic and to crop 3 different bird photos.
