Chitter Application
==================

Introduction
-------
The Chitter application is the fourth weekend challenge at Makers Academy in London. The challenge was to build an application that could handle a user sign up system that would allow users to post peeps to a 'Peep Board'. I have built the application in a test driven approach using RSpec and Capybara. I built my application via the Sinatra framework and the intent was to implement techniques related to relational database mapping. I have used DataMapper and Postgres as the adapter to set up my database. I have added client and database validation to the application in order to enhance user security.
