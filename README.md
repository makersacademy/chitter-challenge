- use spec helpers appropriately, see code review notes

## Bookmark Reference Work Through

### Skipped / Not relevant

14 Heroku

### Skipped / Still To Do

15 Adding tags - test, erb, model, controller
16 filtering by tag - tests, route patterns, has n update to model
17 multiple tags - tests, controller, use of rakefile on Cmd line
25 Refactor dir structure. Nice to do at end

### Done

08 View peeps - test
09 peeps - model, inc in spec_helper
10 view links - controller, views, modular sinatra  
  todo get all tests to pass with instantiation obj row in test
12 Set up database cleaner
  todo lines 42-45 in spec_helper - may work once data in db?
13 config.ru, DataMapper.setup(...) datamapper_setup, app.rb, spec_helper.rb
18 sign up - tests, model, bcrypt, erb. Confirmation to do
19 Confirmation password - test, view, model and controller
20 confirmation fail - flash message with test, controller, model, view
  todo get email to persist on reload
21 validate blank email - test, view/html5, model/dm required/not null
22 No duplicate blank or invalid emails - test, flash erb update
23 login - tests, erb, controller, model inc fail if wrong password/email
24 logout - tests, flash, controller method override delete

### Current Location

All tests passing, can view peeps.
However unable to instantiate Peep in line 5 of peep_spec yet.
wrt to user stories - 'post a peep'
note did 'view peeps' out of sequence which may not have been easiest

11 set up test and form to create link (ie a peep for us) is next to look at
Issue will be joining User and Peep tables via datamapper so is similar
