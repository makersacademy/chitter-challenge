### Relationship:
1 user can make many peeps
Chitter can have many users

## To Set up databases
In psql run the code in the db/migrations folder also creating a test version

## To Run the app
run `bundle`
run `rackup -p 9000`
and then navigate to `localhost:9000`

## To Run tests
run `rspec`

## Current Issues
- no password feature implemented
- usernames are linked to the session and not to the database
- tables needs to link via user_id not username using INTEGER REFERENCES
- users can sign in without a valid username and can sign up multiple times (needs UNIQUE to feature in the username and email columns)
- signing out changes the session to nil whereas should be sessions.clear


Notes on functionality:
------

* You don't have to be logged in to see the peeps.
* Makers sign up to chitter with their email, password, name and a username (e.g. samm@makersacademy.com, password123, Sam Morgan, sjmog).
* The username and email are unique.
* Peeps (posts to chitter) have the name of the maker and their user handle.
