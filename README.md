Chitter Challenge
=================

Task:
-------

We are going to write a little Twitter clone that will allow the users to post messages to a public stream.

Using this repo:
-------

To use this repo simply clone it to your own machine and run bundle to make sure all needed ruby gems are installed. The other thing you will need is your machine set up to use psql (or another appropriate) databases. The final thing you will need is to set up databases for testing, create databases "chitter_test" for when you run rspec tests and "chitter_development" for when running tests in the browser.

Features:
-------
