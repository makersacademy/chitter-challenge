Makers Academy Chitter Challenge
================================

I am creating a very simple Twitter clone, 'Chitter', to demonstrate the use of Relational databases in basic web apps. This will be Test-Driven using Rspec, with the code being handled by Ruby/Sinatra. Database relationships are being handled with DataMapper/Postgres.

## Technologies Used

- Ruby
- Sinatra
- Rspec


## Job List

- Created viable directory structure including config.ru etc
- Created tests and functionality for posting messages to the platform
- Created tests and functionality for signing up

## Still to complete/refactor

- Add logging in, logging out etc
- Add tests and functionality to allow timestamps etc
- limit characters to 141 per peep (one better than twitter itself)
- Add CSS stylings

## Takeaway

Ideally I would have gotten through this a lot further before the end of the weekend. Problems with the directory structure put me back 2 days though, as I repeatedly deleted my structure and repo. Only by carefully analysing the routing for all the required files, gems etc was I able to get a hold on how the project was shaped, and the code and tests began to follow. There is learning in this!
