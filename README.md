# RPS Challenge

A small weekend project at Makers Academy making a Twitter clone that will allow the users to post messages to a public stream.

## Instructions

- Install dependencies from the main directory with:

```
bundle install
```

- Run the server from the main directory with:

```
rackup
```

- Navigate to <http://localhost:9292> and give it a go!

## User Stories

```
As a Maker
So that I can let people know what I am doing  
I want to post a message (peep) to chitter

As a maker
So that I can see what others are saying  
I want to see all peeps in reverse chronological order

As a Maker
So that I can better appreciate the context of a peep
I want to see the time at which it was made

As a Maker
So that I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to sign up for Chitter
```

## Next Steps would have been

- Make a class for Database connection.
-build database for usernames.
-build username class.
- improve the css.
-check email is valid.

## Further user stories. 

HARDER

As a Maker
So that only I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to log in to Chitter

As a Maker
So that I can avoid others posting messages on Chitter as me
I want to log out of Chitter

ADVANCED

As a Maker
So that I can stay constantly tapped in to the shouty box of Chitter
I want to receive an email if I am tagged in a Peep
```

Technical Approach:
-----

This week you integrated a database into Bookmark Manager using the `PG` gem and `SQL` queries. You can continue to use this approach when building Chitter Challenge.

If you'd like more technical challenge this weekend, try using an [Object Relational Mapper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping) as the database interface.

Some useful resources:
**DataMapper**
- [DataMapper ORM](https://datamapper.org/)
- [Sinatra, PostgreSQL & DataMapper recipe](http://recipes.sinatrarb.com/p/databases/postgresql-datamapper)

**ActiveRecord**
- [ActiveRecord ORM](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html)
- [Sinatra, PostgreSQL & ActiveRecord recipe](http://recipes.sinatrarb.com/p/databases/postgresql-activerecord?#article)

Notes on functionality:
------

* You don't have to be logged in to see the peeps.
* Makers sign up to chitter with their email, password, name and a username (e.g. samm@makersacademy.com, password123, Sam Morgan, sjmog).
* The username and email are unique.
* Peeps (posts to chitter) have the name of the maker and their user handle.
* Your README should indicate the technologies used, and give instructions on how to install and run the tests.

Bonus:
-----

If you have time you can implement the following:

* In order to start a conversation as a maker I want to reply to a peep from another maker.

And/Or:

* Work on the CSS to make it look good.

Good luck and let the chitter begin!
