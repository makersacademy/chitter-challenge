Chitter Challenge
=================

```
STRAIGHT UP

As a User
So that I can let people know what I am doing  
I want to post a message (peep) to chitter

As a User
So that I can see what others are saying  
I want to see all peeps in reverse chronological order

As a User
So that I can better appreciate the context of a peep
I want to see the time at which it was made

As a User
So that I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to sign up for Chitter

As a User
So that only I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to log in to Chitter

Notes on functionality:
------

* You don't have to be logged in to see the peeps.
  * You sign up to chitter with their email, password, name and a username (e.g. abc@123.com, password123, John Doe, jdoe).
* The username and email are unique.
* Peeps (posts to chitter) have the name of the user and their user handle.
