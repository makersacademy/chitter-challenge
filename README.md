Chitter Challenge
=================

## Setup
You will need to have PostgresSQL installed locally to run this app.
[PostgreSQL installation guides](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

Once you have setup PostgreSQL
- Create the database with `CREATE DATABASE chitter;`
- Create the table with:
```
CREATE TABLE peeps(
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  peep VARCHAR(140),
  user_email VARCHAR(30),
  time VARCHAR(30)
  );
  ```


- `git clone` this repository
- `bundle install` inside of directory
- The type `rackup` to run the app
- You will see a localhost address(usually localhost:9292)
type that address into a web browser with /chitter
example: `http://localhost:9292/chitter`

## To run tests

- please create the test database `chitter_test` in your local psql
```
CREATE DATABASE chitter_test;
CREATE TABLE peeps(
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  peep VARCHAR(140),
  user_email VARCHAR(30),
  time VARCHAR(30)
  );
```
before running tests

### My approach to this project

I started with BDD with the first two user stories. I then decided, since I was attempting so a few new techniques like Object relational_mapping I would focus on the back end objects and then implement them into the full stack with Capybara testing after the unit testing.

### What I would have done if I had time

- I would have moved the ordering in time responsibility to presenter class. I may have moved the time formatting responsibility there too.

- I would have looked into automating the database creation and table creation (IF EXISTS) in the database_connection_setup file or in a rake file.

- Doing some basic CSS to make it look nice.
- Finishing the other user stories.

Challenge:
-------

As usual please start by forking this repo.

We are going to write a small Twitter clone that will allow the users to post messages to a public stream.

Features:
-------

```
STRAIGHT UP

As a Maker
So that I can let people know what I am doing  
I want to post a message (peep) to chitter

As a maker
So that I can see what others are saying  
I want to see all peeps in reverse chronological order

As a Maker
So that I can better appreciate the context of a peep
I want to see the time at which it was made

As a Maker
So that I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to sign up for Chitter

HARDER

As a Maker
So that only I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to log in to Chitter

As a Maker
So that I can avoid others posting messages on Chitter as me
I want to log out of Chitter

ADVANCED

As a Maker
So that I can stay constantly tapped in to the shouty box of Chitter
I want to receive an email if I am tagged in a Peep
```

Technical Approach:
-----

In this unit, you integrated a database into Bookmark Manager using the `PG` gem and `SQL` queries. You can continue to use this approach when building Chitter Challenge.

If you'd like more technical challenge now, try using an [Object Relational Mapper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping) as the database interface.

Some useful resources:
**Ruby Object Mapper**
- [ROM](https://rom-rb.org/)

**ActiveRecord**
- [ActiveRecord ORM](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html)
- [Sinatra & ActiveRecord setup](https://learn.co/lessons/sinatra-activerecord-setup)

Notes on functionality:
------

* You don't have to be logged in to see the peeps.
* Makers sign up to chitter with their email, password, name and a username (e.g. samm@makersacademy.com, password123, Sam Morgan, sjmog).
* The username and email are unique.
* Peeps (posts to chitter) have the name of the maker and their user handle.
* Your README should indicate the technologies used, and give instructions on how to install and run the tests.

Bonus:
-----

If you have time you can implement the following:

* In order to start a conversation as a maker I want to reply to a peep from another maker.

And/Or:

* Work on the CSS to make it look good.

Good luck and let the chitter begin!

Code Review
-----------

In code review we'll be hoping to see:

* All tests passing
* High [Test coverage](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/main/pills/test_coverage.md) (>95% is good)
* The code is elegant: every class has a clear responsibility, methods are short etc.

Reviewers will potentially be using this [code review rubric](docs/review.md).  Referring to this rubric in advance may make the challenge somewhat easier.  You should be the judge of how much challenge you want at this moment.

Automated Tests:
-----

Opening a pull request against this repository will will trigger Travis CI to perform a build of your application and run your full suite of RSpec tests. If any of your tests rely on a connection with your database - and they should - this is likely to cause a problem. The build of your application created by has no connection to the local database you will have created on your machine, so when your tests try to interact with it they'll be unable to do so and will fail.

If you want a green tick against your pull request you'll need to configure Travis' build process by adding the necessary steps for creating your database to the `.travis.yml` file.

- [Travis - Setting up Databases](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/database-setup/)

Notes on test coverage
----------------------

Please ensure you have the following **AT THE TOP** of your spec_helper.rb in order to have test coverage stats generated
on your pull request:

```ruby
require 'simplecov'
require 'simplecov-console'

SimpleCov.formatter = SimpleCov::Formatter::MultiFormatter.new([
  SimpleCov::Formatter::Console,
  # Want a nice code coverage website? Uncomment this next line!
  # SimpleCov::Formatter::HTMLFormatter
])
SimpleCov.start
```

You can see your test coverage when you run your tests. If you want this in a graphical form, uncomment the `HTMLFormatter` line and see what happens!
