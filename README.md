## Getting Started

### Initial Setup

* You will need Ruby installed, this project uses version 2.7.2
  * Use of a version manager tool such as RVM is recommended
  * You can find documentation for installing RVM [here](https://rvm.io/rvm/install)

* Clone this repository and navigate to the root of the project

```shell
git clone git@github:AJ8GH/chitter-challenge.git
cd chitter-challenge
```

* Install `bundler` if you do not already have it and install project dependenices

```shell
gem install bundler
bundle install
```

* This app uses a PostgreSQL database, so you will need to install and set up Postgres
  * Using a package manager such as Homebrew is recommended
  * You can install Homebrew [here](https://brew.sh/)
  * Then install PostgreSQL with: `brew install postgresql`
  * After Homebrew has downloaded PostgreSQL it will show you some installation instructions: follow them!
  * Next run: `brew services start postgresql` to keep PostgreSQL running in the background

* Create the test and development databases and migrate the table schema

```shell
rake db:create:all
rake db:migrate:all
```

These rake tasks will create 2 databases, `chitter` and `chitter_test`, and migrate the db schema for each. Full details on the database schema can be found in `db/migrations` folder.

## Running Tests

* Ensure you are in the root directory
  * To run entire test suite, run: `rspec`
  * To run only feature tests, run: `rspec spec/features`
  * To run only unit tests, run: `rspec spec/models`
  * To run individual spec files: `rspec spec/<directory_name>/<file_name>`

Notes on the test suite:
* App has been development using outside in TDD, writing a feature test based on a user story, then implementing the feature to make the test pass.
* `Capybara` is used for feature testing and `rspec` is used for unit testing
* Tests are configured to output documentation format
* Suite is configured to automatically connect to the test database before running
* Test database is 'cleaned' after each test

## Usage

To use the app in the local development environment, start the server with `rackup`. Then head to [localhost, port 9292](http://localhost:9292)

```

##### .all

Returns arrray of all instances of the class. Takes no arguments

```ruby
Post.all

```

##### .delete

```ruby
Post.delete(id: 7)
```

##### .find

```ruby
Post.find(id: 7)
```

##### .update

```ruby
post.content

post.content
# => 'Hello World!'
```

##### .user_posts

```ruby
Post.user_posts(user_id: 1)
# => '[user_post1, user_post2, ...]'
```

## Reflections

### Design and approach

- I set out to build a an app which ticks boxes for:
  - CRUD features
  - Use of ORM with postgres database
  - Polished look using CSS
  - RESTful routing
  - Encryption of passwords and authentication of users using sessions
  - Adhering to MVC standards and separation of concerns / SRP.

- User Stories have all been hit, bar email notifications. Instead I prioritised implementing all of the CRUD features for the user info and posts.
- I went for an approach of using ORM and wrapping my database connection in a class. - I applied rake tasks to handle everything to do with environment and db setup. I setup tasks for connecting to the correct database depending on the environmnent, cleaning the database and creating and migrating the database.

## Test and development environments

- Raketask `db:connect` automatically connects to the correct database depending on which environment the app is running in, and outputs a confirmation to the terminal.

- Bcrypt is set up with minimum cost factor in the test environment, so as not to slow down the tests. In development and Production this is higher for additional security.

```ruby
BCrypt::Engine.cost = 1
```

- Test database is cleaned automatically after each test to eliminate test data pollution

### Extending the application

Future features include:
- Email notifications
- Replies and favourites
- Building a frontend interface with React or vanilla JS
