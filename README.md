# Chitter Challenge
=================

Made for Maker's Academy Week 4 - Web Applications

## Challenge:
-------

My attempt at a small Twitter clone that allows the users to post messages to a public stream, based on the following user stories:

You can find the full challenge description in docs/challenge_description.md.

```
STRAIGHT UP

As a Maker
So that I can let people know what I am doing  
I want to post a message (peep) to chitter

As a maker
So that I can see what others are saying  
I want to see all peeps in reverse chronological order

As a Maker
So that I can better appreciate the context of a peep
I want to see the time at which it was made

As a Maker
So that I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to sign up for Chitter

HARDER

As a Maker
So that only I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to log in to Chitter

As a Maker
So that I can avoid others posting messages on Chitter as me
I want to log out of Chitter

ADVANCED

As a Maker
So that I can stay constantly tapped in to the shouty box of Chitter
I want to receive an email if I am tagged in a Peep
```

## Technical Approach:
-----

This is a Ruby app using the Sinatra framework an a PostgreSQL database.

I decided to challenge myself to use ActiveRecord ORM as the database interface, rather than writing Model and Repository Classes. It was a definite leap up in difficulty, but I learned a lot! 

I wrote tests with RSpec and Rack-test.

Bcrypt encrypts passwords, and mail handles email notifications.


## Installation Instructions 
-----

```
git clone https://github.com/awdem/chitter-challenge.git
bundle install
# database creation:
rake db:create
rake db:migrate
# test database creation:
rake db:setup RACK_ENV=test
```

Run RSpec to make sure its working, then go to your localhost in a browser to play around with the app.


##Â KNOWN ISSUES:
-----

My implementation of the advanced mail notification user story is incomplete. It passes in testing, but in order for it to work in practice I believe it needs more set up so that the app can handle email sending. I've made notes in lib/mail_sender.rb on next steps.

The CSS file is very basic and not well thought out! I only added it after doing all the feature implementation so I haven't spent much time with it. I'd love to return to this with more knowledge later to improve the app's look and navigation. 

I couldn't get validation for user password to work, so it can currently be any format, including an empty string. And the app isn't secure from injection (unless there is some protection in ActiveRecord or Sinatra that I don't know about).
