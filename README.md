Chitter Challenge:
=================

Write a small Twitter clone that will allow the users to post messages to a public stream.

Features:
-------

```

As a Maker
So that I can let people know what I am doing  
I want to post a message (peep) to chitter

As a maker
So that I can see what others are saying  
I want to see all peeps in reverse chronological order

As a Maker
So that I can better appreciate the context of a peep
I want to see the time at which it was made

As a Maker
So that I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to sign up for Chitter

```


## How to use

### To set up the project

Clone this repository and then run:

```
bundle
```

### To set up the database and tests

Connect to `psql` and create the `chitter` databases:

```
CREATE DATABASE chitter;
CREATE DATABASE chitter_test;

\c chitter;
CREATE TABLE peeps(id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, peep VARCHAR(60), time TIMESTAMP);

\c chitter_test
CREATE TABLE peeps(id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, peep VARCHAR(60), time TIMESTAMP);

```

To set up the appropriate tables, connect to the database in `psql` and run the SQL scripts in the `db/migrations` folder in the given order. Use the same script for both tables.

### To run the Bookmark Manager app:

```
shotgun
```

To view the app , navigate to `localhost:xxxx`.

### To run tests:

```
rspec
```

### To run linting:

```
rubocop
```

<!-- Technical Approach:
-----

In this unit, you integrated a database into Bookmark Manager using the `PG` gem and `SQL` queries. You can continue to use this approach when building Chitter Challenge.

If you'd like more technical challenge now, try using an [Object Relational Mapper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping) as the database interface.

Some useful resources:
**DataMapper**
- [DataMapper ORM](https://datamapper.org/)
- [Sinatra, PostgreSQL & DataMapper recipe](http://recipes.sinatrarb.com/p/databases/postgresql-datamapper)

Notes on functionality:
------

* You don't have to be logged in to see the peeps.
* Makers sign up to chitter with their email, password, name and a username (e.g. samm@makersacademy.com, password123, Sam Morgan, sjmog).
* The username and email are unique.
* Peeps (posts to chitter) have the name of the maker and their user handle.
* Your README should indicate the technologies used, and give instructions on how to install and run the tests. -->
