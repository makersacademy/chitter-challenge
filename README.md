Chitter Challenge
=================

Write a little Twitter clone that will allow the users to post messages to a public stream.

### User stories for the project:

```
As a User
So that I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to sign up for Chitter

As a User
So that I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to log in to Chitter

As a User
So that I can avoid others posting messages on Chitter as me
I want to log out of Chitter

As a User
So that I can let people know what I am doing  
I want to post a message (peep) to chitter

As a User
So that I can see what others are saying  
I want to see all peeps in reverse chronological order

As a User
So that I can better appreciate the context of a peep
I want to see the time at which it was made
```
