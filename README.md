=======

Chitter is a web application build on the Sinatra framework that emulates the core functionality of Twitter. Users are able to register with a unique email address and once signed-in, can post 'Peeps' (tweets) with tags and images to a public stream.

Users can also:
- View user profiles
- Update a user profile
- Sign out
- Reply to Peeps
- Search Peeps by tag
- Sort peeps in ascending or descending order

A demo of the application can be found on Heroku at https://chitter-week4.herokuapp.com/
