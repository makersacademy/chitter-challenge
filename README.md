## CHITTER README

I'm using this challenge to practice my login, sign up and password security skills. Due to time constraints I won't be completing the challenge.

Another aspect I need to practice with is rspec fluency. This exercise will be test driven (he says...)

Repo forked from Makers, local repo initialized with & rspec-sinatra init Chitter lib/chitter.rb (should have used rspec-sinatra init --app Chitter lib/chitter.rb, which would have created the lib dir, app file and config.ru)
