# Chitter Challenge

I was tasked with making a [Twitter](www.twitter.com) clone for my week four weekend task for [Makers Academy](www.makersacademy.com). I made a social network for cats called [Kitter](https://kitterapp.herokuapp.com/).

## Technologies Used
* PostgreSQL
* Heroku
* Sinatra 
* RSpec 
* Capybara
* Rack
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Database Cleaner 
* DataMapper
* SQL
* BCrypt
* Ruby
* Sinatra Flash

## Notes on functionality:
* Users must sign in with their name, username, email and password.
* I encrypted the password with BCrypt.
* My code was made using test driven development with Capybara.
* Users must sign up with a unique username and email address.

## Features
These are the user stories that I based my project on-

```

As a Maker

I want to see the time at which it was made
```

## Bonus Task:

* Work on the css to make it look good (we all like beautiful things).
