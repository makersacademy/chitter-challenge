Chitter Challenge
=================

Task
-------

To write a small Twitter clone that will allow the users to post messages to a public stream.

I approached this challenge by using a test driven approach. I created the unit and feature tests with Rspec and Capybara:

1) Create a domain model and diagram from the user story
2) Create a failing test (red) in Rspec
3) Develop code to result in a passing test (green)
4) Refactor the code and re-test (orange)
5) Once I have A) high coverage, B) passing Rspec tests, C) code that fulfills the user story. I progress to the next user story and repeat steps 1-5

I used the MVC pattern to develop the web application. 

The server is created with Sinatra.

The database was created using PostgreSQL

The password of users are encrypted in the database with the use of 'bcrypt'

## Getting started

1) git clone path-to-repo
2) Install bundler via `gem install bundle` (if you don't have bundler already)
3) Install dependencies via `bundle`

## Test Code

[Follow these instructions to set-up the PostgreSQL test database](#Database-Setup-for-Testing)

Run rspec from the root directory to test the code and check test coverage

## Run

[Follow these instructions to set-up the PostgreSQL database](#Database-Setup)

In the terminal whilst at the root directory, type `rackup` and press enter
Enter the following url into your preferred browser: http://localhost:9292/

# Database Setup

1. Connect to `psql` (it's important to run this command from the root directory of 'chitter-challenge')
2. Create the database using the `psql` command `CREATE DATABASE messages;`
3. Connect to the database using the `pqsl` command `\c messages;`
4. Run the following commands within psql:
   `\i ./db/migrations/01_create_messages_table.sql`
   `\i ./db/migrations/02_add_creation_to_messages.sql`
   `\i ./db/migrations/03_create_users_table.sql`

# Database Setup for Testing

1. Connect to `psql` (it's important to run this command from the root directory of 'chitter-challenge')
2. Create the database using the `psql` command `CREATE DATABASE messages;`
3. Connect to the database using the `pqsl` command `\c messages;`
4. Run the following commands within psql:
   `\i ./db/migrations/01_create_messages_table.sql`
   `\i ./db/migrations/02_add_creation_to_messages.sql`
   `\i ./db/migrations/03_create_users_table.sql`
