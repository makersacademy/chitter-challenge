## Project aim
To write a small Twitter clone that will allow the users to post messages to a public stream.

### Primary aims
* Post a message (peep) to Chitter. Peeps must have the name of the maker and their user handle.
* View peeps in reverse chronological order (newest first).
* Be able to view the time a peep was posted.
* Be able to sign up to Chitter using email, password, name and a username. The username and email must be unique.

### Secondary aims
* Be able to log in to Chitter (using email and password)
* Be able to log out of Chitter
* Receive an email if tagged in a peep

**User stories**

STRAIGHT UP

As a Maker
So that I can let people know what I am doing  
I want to post a message (peep) to chitter

As a maker
So that I can see what others are saying  
I want to see all peeps in reverse chronological order

As a Maker
So that I can better appreciate the context of a peep
I want to see the time at which it was made

As a Maker
So that I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to sign up for Chitter

As a Maker
So that my identity remain unique
I don't want anyone else having the same username as me

As a Maker
So that my identity remains secure
I want my email address to remain unique

HARDER

As a Maker
So that only I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to log in to Chitter

As a Maker
So that I can avoid others posting messages on Chitter as me
I want to log out of Chitter

ADVANCED

## Domain Model
![Bookmark Manager domain model](./public/images/chitter-dm.png)

| Component   | Responsibility                                | Refactor                                |
|------------ |---------------------------------------------  |---------------------------------------- |
| Model       | Encapsulate logic with relevant data          | Encapsulate peep data in a class    |
| View        | Display the result to a user                  | Show the peep data in a list        |
| Controller  | Get data from the model and put in the view   | Render peep data into to the view   |

## Installation instructions
**Setting up the databases**
Connect to `psql` and create the `chitter` and `chitter_test` databases:
```
CREATE DATABASE chitter;
CREATE DATABASE chitter_test;
```
To set up the appropriate tables, connect to each database in `psql` 
``` 
\c chitter;
\c chitter_test;
```
 Run the SQL scripts in the `db/migrations` folder in the given order.

**Installing the program**
1. Requires Ruby. Instructions to install are [here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/).
2. Fork this repo, and clone to your local machine
3. Run the command `gem install bundle`
4. When the installation completes, run `bundle` 
5. Input `rake setup`
6. Input `rake migrate`
7. Make sure that rspec is up and running.
5. Navigate to the root folder and input 
```rackup```
This will show you the port that you should use in your browser (in this case it is `port=9292`).
6. Input the following into your browser:
```http://localhost:9292/```

### Challenges
* Took a long time to correctly link the users and peeps table together so that the user_id column was the user.id number.
* Trying to work out how to change the display of the peep timestamp has also been difficult. I've managed to remove the milliseconds.
* I haven't managed to do the last user story (under Advanced). I would have also have liked to add in functionality to allow for replies to peeps as well.
* For some reason the picture is broken on the sign up and sign in pages, although the code is identical to the index page.
