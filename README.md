## Learning Objectives

- Build a simple web app with a database
- Follow an effective debugging process for database applications
- Explain the basics of how databases work (e.g. tables, SQL, basic relationships)

## Improvements

- On this challenge I was able to successfully link the database,
however was struggling to get this to be displayed on the view page.
- I would have like more time to add the log in and log out capability.
- I would also like to change my views so that the peeps are displayed
on the same page and new peeps are created.
