# Chitter Challenge

## Objective

To create a twitter clone application using MVC, TDD and OOD principles. Users will be able to post messages to be read on the site.

```
As a Maker
So that I can let people know what I am doing  
I want to post a message (peep) to chitter

```
As a maker
So that I can see what others are saying  
I want to see all peeps in reverse chronological order

```
As a Maker
So that I can better appreciate the context of a peep
I want to see the time at which it was made
```

```
This project is a WIP and I'll return to it.
