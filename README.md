Chitter Challenge
=================

As part of consolidating our learning for the week Makers Academy set us the weekend challenge of creating a Twitter clone called 'Chitter.'

The user stories led us to create the following app features:
* A user can sign up
* A user can sign in and sign out
* A user an post a message (a Peep)
* All peeps had to be displayed in reverse chronological order
* All peeps should have the time it was 'peeped'

```
Chitter is a modular Sinatra application.
It uses DataMapper for interactions with the database (provided by Postgres both locally and on Heroku)
BCrypt is used for authentication.
Styling is through CSS and the app is tested thoroughly with Rspec/Capybara.

```

To use Chitter please:

```
Fork the repo
```
```
$ run Bundle
```
 ```
 Use localling via Sinatra or Rackup
 ```

 Alternatively this app has been deployed to Heroku and can be used at [chitterbyjoe.herokuapp.com](http://chitterbyjoe.herokuapp.com)
