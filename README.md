## To run:

```
bundle install
rackup
```

### You will need to set up a postgreSQL database:

#### Test database:
```
CREATE DATABASE chitter_test;
CREATE TABLE peeps (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, content VARCHAR(240));
ALTER TABLE peeps  ADD created_at TIMESTAMP;
```

Test database will be sufficient if you uncomment line 8 in controller ('./chitter.rb:8'):

```
# ./chitter.rb:8
# for using test database for the server uncomment line below
ENV['ENVIRONMENT'] = 'test'
```

#### If you wish to use separate databases, you need to add:

```
CREATE DATABASE chitter;
CREATE TABLE peeps (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, content VARCHAR(240));
ALTER TABLE peeps  ADD created_at TIMESTAMP;
```

### In browser:

```
http://localhost:9292/
```
