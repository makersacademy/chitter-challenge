Notes on functionality:
------

* Drive the creation of your app using tests - either cucumber or rspec as you prefer
* Makers sign up to chitter with their email, password, name and a user name (e.g. sam@makersacademy.com, s3cr3t, Samuel Russell Hampden Joseph, tansaku).
* The username and email are unique.
* Peeps (posts to chitter) have the name of the maker and their user handle.
* Use bcrypt to secure the passwords.
* Use data mapper and postgres to save the data.
* You don't have to be logged in to see the peeps.
* You only can peep if you are logged in.
* Please ensure that you update your README to indicate the technologies used, and give instructions on how to install and run the tests
* Finally submit a pull request before Monday at 9am with your solution or partial solution.  However much or little amount of code you wrote please please please submit a pull request before Monday at 9am

Bonus:
-----

If you have time you can implement the following:

* In order to start a conversation as a maker I want to reply to a peep from another maker.

And/Or:

* Work on the css to make it look good (we all like beautiful things).

Technologies used:

* Capybara/Rspec for testing
* Sinatra web framework
* DataMapper ORM and PostgresSQL for persistence

Plans for the future of this app:

* Inject some CSS/Bootstrap awesomeness
* Modularize codebase. Refactor heavily.
* Deploy to Heroku

In order to run tests you'll have to fork this repo and run `rspec` in the command line. Ensure that the capybara is added to your Gemfile.
To run the app fork the repo and in the command line:
a) Run rackup in your local directory
b) Run shotgun
c) Run it directly (`ruby chitter.rb`)
