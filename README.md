# Chitter Challenge
## Makers Academy Week 4 Weekend Challenge

#### Introduction

This week's weekend challenge was to build on the previous month of work using OOP and TDD in Ruby and Sinatra, using the Rspec and Capybara testing frameworks, and a PostgreSQL database system alongside DataMapper, to build a Twitter clone. Unfortunately, I encountered a bug my my OpenSSL file, which refused to allow me to install the do_postgres gem necessary to run DataMapper. I eventually resolved this bug with the help of a coach, but was unfortunately unable to complete any work on the project. This is one to come back to.
