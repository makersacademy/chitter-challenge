# Setup

### Live DB

```
% psql -c CREATE DATABASE chitter;
CREATE DATABASE
% psql -d chitter -f ./db/migrations/01_create_users_table.sql
CREATE TABLE
% psql -d chitter -f ./db/migrations/02_create_peeps_table.sql
CREATE TABLE
```

### Test DB

```
% psql -c CREATE DATABASE chitter_test;
CREATE DATABASE
% psql -d chitter_test -f ./db/migrations/01_create_users_table.sql
CREATE TABLE
% psql -d chitter_test -f ./db/migrations/02_create_peeps_table.sql
CREATE TABLE
```

# Run

From repo root directory

```sh
% rackup
```

Open browser to localhost:9292/chitter (amend port 9292 if your set up is different)

You will be able to see any peeps stored in the live DB straightaway, but you must use the Sign Up button before you can post your own peeps.

At the moment you will have to create a new user for every session - duplicate sign ups are prevented, but there's no log-in, log-out functionality.
