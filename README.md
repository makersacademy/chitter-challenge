Chitter Challenge
=================

* Challenge time: Friday afternoon (+ weekend if you need it)
* Feel free to use google, your notes, books, etc but work on your own

Challenge:
-------

We are going to write a little Twitter clone that will allow the users to post messages to a public stream.

Features:
-------

* In order to use chitter as a maker I want to sign up to the service
* In order to user chitter as a maker I want to log in
* In order to avoid others using my account as a maker I want to log out
* In order to let people know what I am doing as a maker I want to post a message (peep) to chitter
* In order to see what people have to say as a maker I want to see all peeps in chronological order

Notes:
------

* Makers sign up to chitter with their email, password, name and a user name (e.g. sam@makersacademy.com, s3cr3t, Samuel Russell Hampden Joseph, tansaku).
* The username and email are unique.
* Peeps (posts to chitter) have the name of the maker and their user handle.
* Use bcrypt to secure the passwords.
* Use data mapper and postgres to save the data.
* You don't have to be logged in to see the peeps.
* You only can peep if you are logged in.
* ***Please ensure that you put all your work in at Github Repository called "Chitter"***

Bonus:
-----

If you have time you can implement the following:

* In order to start a conversation as a maker I want to reply to a peep from another maker.

And/Or:

* Work on the css to make it look good (we all like beautiful things).

Good luck and let the chitter begin!
