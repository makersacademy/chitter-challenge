# Chitter Challenge

## Brief

The purpose of this project was to write a small Twitter clone that would allow the users to post messages to a public stream.

A user doesn't have to be logged in to see the peeps. Users sign up to chitter with their email, password, name and a username, where the username and email are unique. Peeps (posts to chitter) have the name of the maker and their user handle.
