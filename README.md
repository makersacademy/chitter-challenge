Chitter Challenge
=================

Installation instructions
==========================
```
> git clone https://github.com/shezdev/chitter-challenge
> bundle - to install necessary gems / third party libraries
> makersinit - to report git transactions to MA
> coveralls report - to show test coverage
> Created a database chitter_development in postgresql
> Added the following to gem files:
gem "data_mapper"
gem "dm-postgres-adapter"
gem "sinatra"
gem "rspec-sinatra"
gem "capybara" (NB. within the test block)
> bundle install
> require 'capybara/rspec' - added spec_helper.rb
> Created spec/features to hold features test.
> 1st feature test is 1_signup_spec.rb created scenario 1A, rspec fails as no app yet.
> rspec-sinatra init --app Chitter app.rb - to initialize our app from the command line, with RSpec and Capybara all set up.
> rvm use ruby-2.3.3 - Cannot create app with ruby v2.4.0 so changed to use 2.3.3 (and in gemfile)
> gem install bundler, bundle install - to update any dependencies
> rspec-sinatra init --app Chitter app/app.rb - overwrites spec/spec_helper.rb and creates app/app.rb and config.ru
> Added the following to the top of the spec/spec_helper
require 'coveralls'
require 'simplecov'

SimpleCov.formatters = [
  SimpleCov::Formatter::HTMLFormatter,
  Coveralls::SimpleCov::Formatter
]
Coveralls.wear!
> Created first route /signup in app.rb and associated signup_page.erb
> Updated feature test 1B to expect a welcome page when clicking submit
> Creating a model called app/models/chitter_user.rb.



```

Challenge instructions
======================

* Challenge time: rest of the day and weekend, until Monday 9am
* Feel free to use google, your notes, books, etc. but work on your own
* If you refer to the solution of another coach or student, please put a link to that in your README
* If you have a partial solution, **still check in a partial solution**
* You must submit a pull request to this repo with your code by 9am Monday morning

Challenge:
-------

As usual please start by forking this repo.

We are going to write a little Twitter clone that will allow the users to post messages to a public stream.

Features:
-------

```
As a Maker
So that I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to sign up for Chitter

As a Maker
So that I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to log in to Chitter

As a Maker
So that I can avoid others posting messages on Chitter as me
I want to log out of Chitter

As a Maker
So that I can let people know what I am doing  
I want to post a message (peep) to chitter

As a maker
So that I can see what others are saying  
I want to see all peeps in reverse chronological order

As a maker
So that I can better appreciate the context of a peep
I want to see the time at which it was made
```

Notes on functionality:
------

* Drive the creation of your app using tests - either cucumber or rspec as you prefer
* Makers sign up to chitter with their email, password, name and a user name (e.g. sam@makersacademy.com, s3cr3t, Samuel Russell Hampden Joseph, tansaku).
* The username and email are unique.
* Peeps (posts to chitter) have the name of the maker and their user handle.
* Use bcrypt to secure the passwords.
* Use data mapper and postgres to save the data.
* You don't have to be logged in to see the peeps.
* You only can peep if you are logged in.
* Please ensure that you update your README to indicate the technologies used, and give instructions on how to install and run the tests
* Finally submit a pull request before Monday at 9am with your solution or partial solution.  However much or little amount of code you wrote please please please submit a pull request before Monday at 9am

Bonus:
-----

If you have time you can implement the following:

* In order to start a conversation as a maker I want to reply to a peep from another maker.

And/Or:

* Work on the css to make it look good (we all like beautiful things).

Good luck and let the chitter begin!

Code Review
-----------

In code review we'll be hoping to see:

* All tests passing
* High [Test coverage](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/test_coverage.md) (>95% is good)
* The code is elegant: every class has a clear responsibility, methods are short etc.

Reviewers will potentially be using this [code review rubric](docs/review.md).  Referring to this rubric in advance may make the challenge somewhat easier.  You should be the judge of how much challenge you want this weekend.

Notes on test coverage
----------------------

Please ensure you have the following **AT THE TOP** of your spec_helper.rb in order to have test coverage stats generated
on your pull request:

```ruby
require 'coveralls'
require 'simplecov'

SimpleCov.formatters = [
  SimpleCov::Formatter::HTMLFormatter,
  Coveralls::SimpleCov::Formatter
]
Coveralls.wear!
```

You can see your [test coverage](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/test_coverage.md) when you submit a pull request, and you can also get a summary locally by running:

```
$ coveralls report
```

This repo works with [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/) to calculate test coverage statistics on each pull request.
