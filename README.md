You've come to Dash's Chitter! Good effort!

This web app will allow you to say what's on your mind (as long as it's no longer than 200 characters obviosuly!) so that all your friends will be able to see what you are thinking and what you are up to!

To run, have PG installed as a gem.

If you need to set up the database from scratch do the following:

- Connect to psql
- Create the database using the psql command CREATE DATABASE chitter_database;
- Connect to the database using the psql command \c chitter_database;
- Run the query we have saved in the file 01_create_peeps_table.sql
