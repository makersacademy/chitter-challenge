Welcome to Chitter [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/guilhe0756/chitter-challenge.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/guilhe0756/chitter-challenge)
=================

Let the ~world~ know what you are thinking!

# Instructions

Clone this repository in your terminal and run ```bundle```

Before testing, please change the file 'setup_test_database' to read 'chitter_test' instead of 'travis_ci_test'.

Open ```psql``` and create two databases by typing ```CREATE DATABASE chitter;``` and then  ```CREATE DATABASE chitter_test;``` (Don't forget the semi-colon at the end!!!)

If you wish to test it, just run ```rspec```. Otherwise, type ```rackup -p 9292```, jump to your browser and type 'localhost:9292'.

Finally, start tweeting! I mean... start chipping! That sounds odd... start posting!

### System

Developed in Ruby using Sinatra, Capybara, Rake and ActiveRecord.
Test-driven all the way through.

### Objective

Practice what I have learned during the first four weeks of my bootcamp at Makers Academy â€“ which included building a full-stack web app (including database management!)

### For this exercise, I'll be happy if I...

...successfully integrate ActiveRecord to manage the databases. Plus, if I have a thin controller and a model that has neatly differentiated classes, each with methods that respect SRP and are no more than 5 lines long.
