Chitter Challenge
=================

A little Twitter clone that will allow users, specifically bugs, to post messages to a public stream.

One can both sign up and sign in, depending if they already have an existing account. 


Features:
* You don't have to be logged in to see the peeps.
* Sign up to critter with their email, password, name and a user name (e.g. sam@makersacademy.com, s3cr3t, Samuel Russell Hampden Joseph, tansaku).
* The username and email are unique.
* Creets (posts to critter) have the username of the maker.
* You only can creet if you are logged in.

Packages:
* Data mapper and postgres used to save the data.
* bcrypt used to secure the passwords.
