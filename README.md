To install and run this app locally follow these instructions:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/JackOddy/chitter-challenge.git

$ bundle

$ rackup config.ru
```

This app is basically a twitter clone. A user can sign up and then post 'peeps' from their account.

Reply functionality is not quite completed yet as an additional model needs to be created that belongs to the peep table and links a peep to other peep.
