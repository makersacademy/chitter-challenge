The Chitter challenge is a 'Friday Challenge' set to try and test your knowledge of 'integrating a database into a software application'.

## Description
The program should post a message (peep) to chitter, display them in reverse chronological order, display the time it was posted and allow a user to sign up to Chitter.

## Installation
You will need to install bundle, and run the Sql files included to create the required tables.

## Roadmap
A future release may include the functionality of logging in and out Chitter in order to post a peep and receiving an email if the user is tagged in a peep.
