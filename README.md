## README

This is my attempt at the Makers Academy Chitter challenge.

Here are the user stories that I completed:

```
As a Maker
So that I can let people know what I am doing  
I want to post a message (peep) to chitter

As a maker
So that I can see what others are saying  
I want to see all peeps in reverse chronological order

As a Maker
So that I can better appreciate the context of a peep
I want to see the time at which it was made
```

I attempted to implement the user sign up but this isn't working yet and I can't figure out why.

## Instructions on how to run

```
$ git clone https://github.com/amybalmforth/chitter-challenge.git
$ cd chitter-challenge
$ bundle
$ rackup
$ in browser go to localhost:9292
```
