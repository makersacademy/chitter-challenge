Chitter Challenge
=================

* completed user story 1.
* attempted user story 2 which worked, however when I came to attempting user story 3 
I couldn't figure out the logic to maintain the reverse orders as well as displaying the time.
* when user fills in the time, it saves into the database, however I'm unable to see it in my views.

Technical Approach:
-----

In this unit, you integrated a database into Bookmark Manager using the `PG` gem and `SQL` queries. You can continue to use this approach when building Chitter Challenge.

If you'd like more technical challenge now, try using an [Object Relational Mapper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping) as the database interface.

Some useful resources:
**Ruby Object Mapper**
- [ROM](https://rom-rb.org/)

**ActiveRecord**
