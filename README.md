This is the my attempt at the week 4 weekend challenge, which involves writing a very basic Twitter clone, in Ruby and and the 'pg' (postgres sql) gem. A number of other gems were also used, 'sinatra' and 'sinatra-reloader', as well as webrick as I was using ruby 3.0.2, this is contrary to what is in the .ruby-version as rubocop does not support 3.0 
```(Error: RuboCop found unknown Ruby version 3.0 in .` ruby-version.` Supported versions: 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7) ```

The basic challenge involved the following user stories

```

As a Maker
So that I can let people know what I am doing  
I want to post a message (peep) to chitter

As a maker
So that I can see what others are saying  
I want to see all peeps in reverse chronological order

As a Maker
So that I can better appreciate the context of a peep
I want to see the time at which it was made

As a Maker
So that I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to sign up for Chitter

```
Two databases were created, one for testing and one for the actual app, these are named chitter and chitter_test. Each database also has two tables, the creation of which is per the 01_create_peeps_table.sql and 02_create_users_table.sql. 

## Database setup

1. In the Gemfile add the following ``` gem 'pg' ```
2. Open terminal/command line
3. Install the gem via the ```bundle install``` command at the promt
4. Type ```psql``` at prompt
5. CREATE DATABASE chitter
6. Connect to the database using \c chitter
7. Create peeps table as per 01_create_peeps_table.sql
8. Create users table as per 02_create_users_table.sql

To set up the test database follow the above steps, with the following amendment
5. CREATE DATABASE chitter_test

## Reflection

Currently the app fulfils the basic user stories, however there is currently no signing in or out functionality, this is something I would like to look into when I have the opportunity. However it is possible to sign up, as per user story 4, however there is no checks and if the username or email are already in the database then a 500 error will occur. Peeps are currently displayed in reverse chronological order, with the timestamp and username, I would've also liked to have added the functionality to choose if the peeps in chronological or reverse chronological order, however as this is not requested in any of the user stories I did not do so, which was a surprisingly difficult thing. The user interfce is not very pretty at the moment and definitely needs work. I also feel I need to spend more time understanding ORM frameworks, as well as Class methods. 

Simplecov gives a 100% coverage, however I'm not overlly happy as I was unable to envision a feature test for signing up that didnt require the user to also post a peep, as I wasn't sure on how to confirm that signing up had been succesful, also the test requires a lot of setup, and I was wondering if a helper would be appropriate however as the setup is not used again I opted against that. I do have 6 rubocop offences mainly related to line length in either creating new instances or SQL commands, and to reduce the length would require making the methods longer as I would need to assign the values to various variables.
