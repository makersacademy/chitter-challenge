### Chitter Challenge
<hr>
 
#### The idea
A twitter clone that will allow the users to post messages to a public stream.

##### App capabilities:

Users can:
- [x] post a message (peep) to chitter
- [x] see what others are saying  
- [ ] see all peeps in reverse chronological order
- [ ] see the time at which it was made
- [ ] sign up for Chitter
- [ ] log in to Chitter
- [ ] log out of Chitter

_current app state: anyone can post peeps and see the stream_

#### Built with

Ruby, Sinatra, ActiveRecord, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS 
 
_learning how to work with ActiveRecord took me 9 hours, <br>so unfortunately I ran out of time and this project is very much unfinished_ üôÅ
