Chitter Challenge
=================

Week 4 Weekend Challenge
--------

For the fourth weekend challenge, I had to create a web application similar to Twitter. On this web application, it needed to be possible to sign up, log in and log out. When logged in, the user would be able to submit a 'peep', which would then appear on a public feed that everyone could see, along with the username of the poster and the time it was posted.

The web application can be found [here](http://ch1tter.herokuapp.com).

Given more time, I would like to make it possible to reply to peeps.
