# WEEK 4 - CHITTER Challenge

To build a TWITTER clone using psql database.

## Getting Started

I finished this challenge and also did the bonus of sign in and sign out. I have organised all files into their respective folders.

### Prerequisites

You should be able to run it via the config.ru file with rackup. The starting page would be the /users/new page for new sign ups and that should lead through the subsequent pages.

## Running the tests

I have separated the tests into the feature and unit test folders. Rspec will run them all and they are passing with full coverage.

### REFLECTION

After initially taking time to figure out my approach to this, I found it to be a very useful challenge in getting a better understanding of the various facets of databases. I am now more comfortable with PSQL, Sinatra, Capybara and using modules.


### WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO IMPROVE

I got everything to work and the program is fairly robust. I wasn't able to figure out how to have the user's name persist on the post list so that old posts can be viewed without signing in.

Though I was very happy with the finished product, if I had more time...

```
1. Figure out how to have a username saved next to the post even after sign out.
```
