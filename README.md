Technical Approach:
-----

Integrate a database using the `PG` gem and `SQL` queries. 

## Technologies Used:

* Ruby
* Rspec
* Capybara
* PG
* Postgresql
* Sinatra
* Travis
* Html
* CSS


Notes on functionality:
------

* You don't have to be logged in to see the peeps.
* Makers sign up to chitter with their email, password, name and a username (e.g. samm@makersacademy.com, password123, Sam Morgan, sjmog).
* The username and email are unique.
* Peeps (posts to chitter) have the name of the maker and their user handle.
* Your README should indicate the technologies used, and give instructions on how to install and run the tests.
