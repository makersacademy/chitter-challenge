### To set up the project

Clone this repository and then run:

```
bundle
```

### To set up the database

Connect to `psql` and create the `chitter` and `chitter_test` databases:

```
CREATE DATABASE chitter;
CREATE DATABASE chitter_test;
```

To set up the appropriate tables, connect to each database in `psql` and run the SQL scripts in the `db/migrations` folder in the given order.

```
rackup
```

To view bookmarks, navigate to `localhost:9292/peeps`

rspec
```

### To run linting:

rubocop
```

## Notes on functionality:

- You don't have to be logged in to see the peeps.
- Makers sign up to chitter with their email, password, name and a username (e.g. samm@makersacademy.com, password123, Sam Morgan, sjmog).
- The username and email are unique.
- Peeps (posts to chitter) have the name of the maker and their user handle.
- Your README should indicate the technologies used, and give instructions on how to install and run the tests.
