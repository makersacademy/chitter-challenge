Chitter Challenge
=================

We are going to write a little Twitter clone that will allow the users to post messages to a public stream.

Features:
-------

```

As a Maker
So that I can let people know what I am doing  
I want to post a message (peep) to chitter

As a maker
So that I can see what others are saying  
I want to see all peeps in reverse chronological order

As a Maker
So that I can better appreciate the context of a peep
I want to see the time at which it was made

As a Maker
So that I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to sign up for Chitter

```

Completed the above user stories. Would expand it so that it was possible to log in and log out with more time. Would have also done more css as well.
