#### Makers Academy Week4 - Chitter challenge

### Forget about twitter, use Chitter! [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/makersacademy/chitter-challenge.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/makersacademy/chitter-challenge)

### 1. Introduction
Chitter is a user-friendly web browser-based application that allows you to communicate with fellow chitters. You can choose to use it either as a guest or a registered user. As a guest, you can see others' peeps and comments. As a user, you are able to post and comment on peeps.

### 2. Development
Chitter is written in **Ruby 2.2.3** and has been developed using **Sinatra 1.4.7** ( https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra ). It uses **RSpec 3.2.2** as a platform for behaviour-driven development (BDD) in conjunction with **Capybara 2.6.2** ( https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara#using-capybara-with-rspec ) as an acceptance test framework. The continuous integration is assessed through Travis-CI with the latest test coverage of 100%.

Password encryption for safer services is provided by **bcrypt** ( https://github.com/codahale/bcrypt-ruby ). The Database is managed by **PostgreSQL** ( http://www.postgresql.org/ ), an open-source Object-Relational Database Management System (ORDBMS). The communication between the database and the application is performed via **DataMapper** ( http://datamapper.org/ ). Online version is supported by a cloud application platform **Heroku** ( https://www.heroku.com/ ).
