# Chitter Challenge

I was tasked with making a [Twitter](www.twitter.com) clone for my week four weekend task for [Makers Academy](www.makersacademy.com). I made a social network for cats called Kitter, Some of the technologies I used were PostgreSQL, Heroku, Sinatra, RSpec, Capybara, Rack, HTML5, CSS3, Database Cleaner, DataMapper, SQL, BCrypt, Ruby, Sinatra Flash.

Notes on functionality:
* Users must sign in with their name, username, email and password.
* I encrypted the password with BCrypt.
* My code was made using test driven development with Capybara.
* Users must sign up with a unique username and email address.

## Features
These are the user stories that I based my project on-
