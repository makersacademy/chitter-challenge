## Introduction

Welcome to my repo for the Makers Academy weekend challenge(4). My task was to create a clone of the popular social-media website "Twitter", using databases, SQL languages, Sinatra, Capybara, and Rake.

## Useage

- Type ```bundle install``` into your terminal emulator.
- Type ```rake set_up``` to initialize the databases.
- Jump for joy!
- Weep with relief (if it works!)

## Specification

- [x] The user can post a message (peep).
- [ ] The user can view all of the previous peeps in reverse chronological order.
- [ ] The user can see the time that each peep was created.
- [ ] The user can sign-up (register) their membership to the page.

## Difficulties

Everything.
