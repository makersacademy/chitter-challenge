I want to see the time at which it was made

As a User
So that I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to sign up for Chitter

Notes on functionality:
------

* The creation of my app has been driven by using rspec tests
* I have used data mapper and postgres to save the data.
* You don't have to be logged in to see the peeps.
* Users sign up to chitter with their email, password, name and a user name
* The username and email are unique.
* Peeps (posts to chitter) have the name of the user and their user handle.
* I have used bcrypt to secure the passwords.
* You only can peep if you are logged in.
