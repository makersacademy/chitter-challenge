4. Sign up a few users (some with your real email addresses, best with gmail), play around to register same email and username twice to see the error messages
5. Sign out

### Infrastructure

- Web Framework: Sinatra
- Test Framework: Capybara, rspec
- Database: PostgreSQL

---------
### Overview

- Covered all functions, test coverage 100%
- Responsive web pages (scale up/down when resize browser window)
- Styling
- Deal with apostrophes in text fields before passing to database

---------
### Issues and Future Scope

- Improve the function of finding tagged user(s). Currently, the code search if message contains @username in the string. However, it will cause problem i.e. having 2 users: bob, bobby, if tag @bobby, @bob also part of the string, and both will be considered tagged.
- Found out how to test emails sending successfully or not
- Add more functions: i.e. reply messages
- Use database on the cloud
- Host site on the cloud
