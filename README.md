Technologies
-----

This project is created with: 
* Ruby 3.0.2
* Postgresql
* Sinatra
* Rspec
* Capybara
* Rackup
* Rubocop
* Webrick 1.3.1

Installation:
-----

To set up this application:

1. Clone this repo:
```
https://github.com/Aisha-Yusuff/chitter-challenge
```

2. Install all the gems

```
bundle install
```

3. Set up RSpec, 
```
rspec --init
```

This will create a spec directoy and spec_helper.rb file.

4. Set up Sinatra by creating app.rb file and add this to your file 

```
# in app.rb

require 'sinatra/base'
require 'sinatra/reloader'

class Chitter < Sinatra::Base
  configure :development do
    register Sinatra::Reloader
  end

  get '/' do
    'Hello World'
  end

  run! if app_file == $0
end
```

5. Create config.ru file to configure rackup command

```
# in config.ru

require_relative "./app"

run Chitter
```

6. Connect capybara with sinatra by adding this to your spec_helper.rb file

```
# at the top of spec/spec_helper.rb

# Set the environment to "test"
ENV['RACK_ENV'] = 'test'

# Bring in the contents of the `app.rb` file. The below is equivalent to: require_relative '../app.rb'
require File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), '..', 'app.rb')

# Require all the testing gems
require 'capybara'
require 'capybara/rspec'
require 'rspec'

# Tell Capybara to talk to Chitter
Capybara.app = Chitter
```

Databases:
------

Chitter maintains two databases, the first one is also named chitter and the second database is named chitter_test.

To create each database:

1. Download PostgresSQL
2. Run psql
3. Then run the following psql commands:
```
CREATE DATABASE chitter
CREATE DATABASE chitter_test
```
4. Then enter each database using
```
\c 'database-name'
```

5. Finally run the psql commands in the db/migrations directory to create the accounts and peeps table for each database. 


Notes on functionality:
------
* You don't have to be logged in to see the peeps.
* Makers sign up to chitter with their email, password, name and a username (e.g. samm@makersacademy.com, password123, Sam Morgan, sjmog).
* The username and email are unique.
* Peeps (posts to chitter) have the name of the maker and their user handle.
* Your README should indicate the technologies used, and give instructions on how to install and run the tests.

Roadmap:
-----

There is still more features that can be added to this application. The current application only fulfils the first four user stories. Here is a list of feature that need to be completed in order to fulfil the remaining user stories:
- [ ] Allow users to log in and log out
- [ ] The timestamp for when a post is created should only display time 
- [ ] When a user logs in and creates a peep, the name and username should also be displayed within the peep
- [ ] Users can receive emails if they are tagged in peeps
- [ ] Add CSS linksheet to improve the design of the application
