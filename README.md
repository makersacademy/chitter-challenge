Chitter
=================

**Chitter** is a small Twitter clone that will allow the users to post messages to a public stream.

This program was built  using **TDD** as part of [**Makers Academy Coding Bootcamp's**]([http://makers.tech](http://makers.tech/)) RPS Challenge (from which this repository was forked on 2021-April-25).

## Installation

This program requires **Ruby version 3.0.0**. If you are unsure if you have Ruby installed, or need help seeing the version you are using [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com) provide this useful guide to [**setup Ruby**](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/ruby-setup).

## Set up Database and tables

1. Connect to psql
1. Create the database using the psql command CREATE DATABASE chitter;
1. Connect to the database using the pqsl command \c chitter;

Notes on functionality:
------

* You don't have to be logged in to see the peeps.
* Users sign up to chitter with their email, password, name and a username (e.g. samm@makersacademy.com, password123, Sam Morgan, sjmog).
* The username and email are unique.
* Peeps (posts to chitter) have the name of the user and their user handle.
* Your README should indicate the technologies used, and give instructions on how to install and run the tests.
