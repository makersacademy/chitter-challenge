* Can view peeps (tweets) whether logged in or logged out
* Can only post peeps when logged in
* Peeps state the time they were posted
* Peeps are posted in reverse chronological order

CSS Design and Style Inspiration
------
I was listening to the Wild Beasts latest album "Boy King" whilst coding this challenge. I checked out their website and loved the big bold colours and design. That served as a large part of the inspiration for this design.
