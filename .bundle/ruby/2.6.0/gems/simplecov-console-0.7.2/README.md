## Configuration

### Disabling colorized output

Simply export `NO_COLOR=1` and colors will be disabled.

```sh
NO_COLOR=1 rake test
```

### Sorting the output

By default the coverage report is sorted by coverage % in descending order.  To sort alphabetically by path, set the `SORT` environment variable to "path", or add the following to your test helper:

```ruby
SimpleCov::Formatter::Console.sort = 'path' # sort by file path
```

### Showing covered files

By default, fully covered files are excluded from the report.  To show them, set the `SHOW_COVERED` environment variable to `true` or add the following to your test helper:

```ruby
SimpleCov::Formatter::Console.show_covered = true # show all files in coverage report
```

### Maximum rows displayed

By default, a maximum of 15 files with the worst coverage are displayed in the report.  You can override this limit by setting the `MAX_ROWS` environment variable, or adding the following to your test helper:

```ruby
SimpleCov::Formatter::Console.max_rows = # some number
```

Setting a value of `-1` or `nil` will show all of the files.

### Table options

In some cases, you may need to pass some options to `TerminalTable.new`. For example, if the filenames are
truncated so much that you can't read them. In that case, you can add a line like this when setting the formatter:

```ruby
SimpleCov::Formatter::Console.table_options = {:style => {:width => 200}}
SimpleCov.formatter = SimpleCov::Formatter::Console
```

### Block output style

As an alternative to the default table output format, results can be printed as plain text blocks instead by setting
the formatter `output_style` to 'block':

```ruby
SimpleCov::Formatter::Console.output_style = 'block'
SimpleCov.formatter = SimpleCov::Formatter::Console
```

Example output:

```text

* Fork the project.
* Start a feature/bugfix branch.
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
