# Chitter

This is the development notes for the Makers Chitter application. At it's current stage I have only accomplished the first three user stories for this application. I have yet to implement a login system for this app. 

Below are the notes followed for setting up the web application:
https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/ruby_web_project_setup_list.md

Below are the user stories for this project:

```
As a Maker
So that I can let people know what I am doing  
I want to post a message (peep) to chitter

As a maker
So that I can see what others are saying  
I want to see all peeps in reverse chronological order

As a Maker
So that I can better appreciate the context of a peep
I want to see the time at which it was made

As a Maker
So that I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to sign up for Chitter

HARDER

As a Maker
So that only I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to log in to Chitter

As a Maker
So that I can avoid others posting messages on Chitter as me
I want to log out of Chitter

ADVANCED

As a Maker
So that I can stay constantly tapped in to the shouty box of Chitter
I want to receive an email if I am tagged in a Peep
```

Currently I have completed the first three stories for this Chitter application:

* By pressing 'Peep' you can post a new peep to the Chitter page.
* Each peep is posted in reverse chronological order
* Each peep will have a timestamp next to the message

Here is the current webpage layout for Chitter:
