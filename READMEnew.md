This is an attempt at the twitter clone, "Chitter" weekend challenge.

I have completed a sign up method. In order to finish off the challenge I still need to implement a log-in/log-out functionality.
I would also need to implement a way to view the tweets (called "peeps") with their relevant info in reverse chronological order 
and to create and post tweets.
