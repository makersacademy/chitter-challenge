Trying to build an app simplier to 'Twitter', which is guided by the following user stories:

As a Maker, so that I can post messages on Chitter as me, I want to sign up for Chitter.

As a Maker, so that I can post messages on Chitter as me, I want to log in to Chitter.

As a Maker, so that I can avoid others posting messages on Chitter as me, I want to log out of Chitter.

As a Maker, so that I can let people know what I am doing, I want to post a message (peep) to chitter.

As a Maker, so that I can see what others are saying, I want to see all peeps in reverse chronological order.

As a Maker, so that I can better appreciate the context of a peep, I want to see the time at which it was made.

Chitter has a basic homepage, and the ability to sign up new users. Currently working on password confirmation.
