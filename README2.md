Trying to build an app simplier to 'Twitter', which is guided by the following user stories:

I want to sign up for Chitter.

As a Maker

As a Maker
So that I can avoid others posting messages on Chitter as me

As a maker
So that I can let people know what I am doing  
I want to post a message (peep) to chitter.

As a maker
So that I can see what others are saying  
I want to see all peeps in reverse chronological order.

As a maker
So that I can better appreciate the context of a peep
I want to see the time at which it was made.

First user story complete as people can now sign up for Chitter.
